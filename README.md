## <a href="#link1" id="link0">The 20 Most Evil People Alive </a>
1. Henry Kissinger.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/031228/87282539/kissenger.png">

During the Vietnam war , he secretly derailed peace talks between the North and South Vietnamese, because he wanted the war to continue and help his career , right through to the next president.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/031800/87282554/el-chapo.png">

He also personally planned bombings of targets in Cambodia , who were not even a part of the war. He had no military training or knowledge , he chose random targets he thought would stop supply lines to Vietnam. These were planned in secret , without congress knowing. - u/Fluffy_Morning_1569

2. El Chapo and Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (leader of CJNG), they are horrid people who have fueled violence, opioid deaths via spiking drugs with Fentanyl, traffic people, etc etc… but there are some rumors that Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes is dead which I hid hope is true

3. The post is about the most evil person on the planet, not a list of any evil person. People are commenting “Casey Anthony” and other people who have murdered a handful of individuals which is obviously evil, but nothing compared to world leaders causing the deaths of millions or someone like Kim Jong-un torturing an entire population for generations prolonging their suffering for as long as possible. - u/ChaDefinitelyFeel

4. Warren Jeffs is up there. Cult leader who managed to gain control of about 20-40k people's lives by moving them all to a place that is completely controlled by the cult. Managed to take a lot of their companies and has a lot of financial power.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/040450/87282577/murdoch.png">

He then used this money to make a temple dedicated to raping the children of cult members.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/040609/87282578/sackler.png">

They still worship him to this day despite him being in jail. - u/Nutteralex-Gaming

5. Larry Fink.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/123436/87282351/ghis.jpg">

Look up Blackrock. They practically own the world and decide which direction we are heading by brainwashing people and manipulating companies worldwide by having a tight grip on the economy and a shit-ton of money.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/123440/87282352/kiss.jpg">

Seriously, this company is the worst and Larry Fink is the closest person to dystopic evil villain we will probably ever get.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/123443/87282353/lostprophets.jpg">

6. Rupert Murdoch has to be up there. Perhaps not as much shocking, sadistic evil as many mentioned here, but I don’t think anyone else alive is responsible for as much pain, death, misery, and general human suffering as him. He’s been spreading hate and dividing nations all over the world for decades. He’s responsible in large part for the politicization of covid that led to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of unnecessary deaths. He had a big part in getting Roe V. Wade overturned, which has already caused a ton of anguish and will lead to many deaths. He’s helped get right-wing zealots elected in many countries who went on to start wars that cost thousands of lives.

I truly believe his propaganda has set the world back nearly a century
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/123447/87282354/luis.jpg">

7. Richard Sackler and other members of the Sackler family. They ran Purdue Pharma leading up to and during most of the opioid crisis. They pushed misinformation that lead to doctors overprescribing OxyContin. They made billions off the bodies of hundreds of thousands.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/123448/87282355/putin.jpg">

8. Josef Fritzl. One of the most heartbreaking cases I have ever heard of. Fritzl imprisoned his daughter in a tiny basement under his home, for 24 years at the age of 18! In these 24 years of imprisonment, Fritzl constantly raped his daughter, resulting in several miscarriages and seven children.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/123456/87282356/scientology.jpg">

Three of the children remained with their mother Elizabeth in captivity, three were raised by Fritzl and his wife, Rosemarie, and one was killed by Fritzl after birth, and disposed of in an incinerator. Fritzl would show Elizabeth porn videos, which he would then force her to re-enact them with him, in front of her children, to humiliate her. -SirClorox

9. Ghislaine maxwell she's pretty f**king evil and she gets go to minimum security prison granted she'll probably die there. -More-Escape3704
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/123500/87282358/rwanda.jpg">

10. Once you been to Cambodia you’ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands. -Anthony Bourdain. -dangit1590

11. Ian Watkins, the lead singer from Lost Prophets. That thing IS EVIL. -WonderfulEmployee999
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/05/123504/87282359/ugandan.jpg">

12. Carolyn Bryant, the woman who lied about Emmett Till. -IuPtheScORe

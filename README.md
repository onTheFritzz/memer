<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/12/052131/87286529/bunk.png">

5. Staying home on a sick day.  As a kid it was a huge victory, got to stay in bed all day, watch TV, and having a parent tend to your every need. Then as an adult you're just thinking about the work you're gonna have to make up for and how you hope you don't need to go to a doctor. --eDgAR-

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/12/052148/87286535/dew.png">

9. Getting mail. I remember everyday begging my parents if I got mail. (I had pen pals). I got so excited when something came for me. Now I dread going to the mailbox because all that will be there are bills. -Slowmechanic180
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/12/052149/87286536/mail.png">

10. Going to McDonalds. As a kid, it was a victory. As an adult, it's defeat and sadness. -BrokenZen

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/12/052201/87286542/ride.png">

17. Summer. When you’re a kid, it's three months of freedom from school. When you’re an adult, you still have to go to work, but now it’s sweltering hot and you’re sweating your balls off all day, every day. -chadthundertalk
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/12/052204/87286543/summer.png">

20. Twinkies. When I was a kid, they were the greatest things I've ever tasted. A couple of years ago I bought a package of two to share with my 10 year old, and neither of us got past a single bite. Those things are wretched. -doctor-rumack

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">What You Could Buy With The Amount Spent On The 2016 Election</a>
1. 1. A Round Trip To The Moon - A group called Golden Spike is setting in place citizen visits to the moon, and you can go for only $750 million! For 1.5 billion you can actually walk on the moon, but that would be above your campaign funds.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068285.jpg">

2. 2. You Could Finance The Rest Of The Star Wars Movies - For $800 million you can either continue the greatness that George Lucas started or totally destroy it. Think about it, all the characters could simply get together and have a nice My Dinner With Andre type supper for two hours on your watch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068286.jpg">

3. 3. You Could Stay At The Most Expensive Hotel In the World For 50 Years - The Royal Penthouse Suite at Geneva’s Hotel President Wilson is the epitome of luxury, and it could be your apartment for 50 years. With a 103" Bang & Olufsen flat screen TV, twelve bedroom and bathrooms, jacuzzi, billiard room and a terrace around the outside of the apartment with a view of the beautiful Alps, this might be the way to go. If you just want to stay now, it's only $83,200 USD a night.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068287.jpg">

4. 4. 1962 Ferrari 250 GT0 - The most expensive car in the world has a price tag of $35 million. You could by 40 of them. Just crash one at an auto show to make a bunch of old men cry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068288.jpg">

5. 5. The Chicago Cubs - This loved, down on its luck team could be all yours for the small price of $1 billion dollars. You could be the person to re-invent the oldest sports team in North America! And think, you'll still have extra money to take strippers and booze to your suite to watch the game!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068289.jpg">

6. 6. Restore the Gulf of Mexico - You could do something for humanity, like restoring the Gulf of Mexico which has the working price tag of $1 billion. After the Deep Horizon oil spill, BP gave $1 billion to states to help the cleanup effort, however, experts say the cleanup is far from over. Just use your money to help millions of people you jerk!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068290.jpg">

7. 7. The Hannah Montana Franchise - For $1 billion you could own all the rights and merchandising to one of the biggest teen pop franchises in history. However, now that it's over you'll probably only make money from Hannah Montana hairbrushes or some shit they sell at K-Mart. On second thought, just buy a ship with a huge hole in it, at least you can watch it sink like Miley's career.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068291.jpg">

8. 8. You Could Build 10,000 Schools For Unfortunate Children - Yep that's right! For the amount of money, the candidates are using to scream at each other and basically lie to all of us, they could be helping kids! With the foundation Pencils of Promise, you could fund the building of 10,000 schools that would help kids around the world for only $250 million. You would still have so much money and you know how much ass you would get for doing this?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068292.jpg">

9. 9. Rangyai Island - This beautiful private island could be all yours for the low price of $160 million. With close proximity to Thailand, you can easily get fresh food cooked by your own private chefs and a few guest to the island if you know what I mean . . .
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068293.jpg">

10. 10. Do Whatever You F*cking Want - When it comes down to it, $1 billion dollars converts to $2,739,726 dollars a day. If you just sit in your house and jerk off and play Playstation, that means you save $2,739,726 dollars a day, that's $31.07 every second you sit on your ass. Just enjoy how much money you spend and whatever you do, don't think about how all this money is being used to promote two turds to run our country.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">18 Weird Rules That Actually Apply In Sports</a>
1. In soccer, if you score a goal and you take your shirt off when celebrating, you get a yellow card.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829977.jpg">

2. In Canadian football, you get one point for MISSING a field goal as long as it has enough distance to land past the end zone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829964.jpg">

3. Ultimate frisbee is self-officiating, as in the players call fouls, travels, etc. Then the player they called it on can contest the call or not, leading to a lot of arguments on the field.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829971.jpg">

4. The driver who gets the most mentions on Twitter during a race gets to use extra power (it’s electric Formula racing, so they can do that in software for some amount of time).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829965.jpg">

5. In hockey if you high stick it’s a two minute penalty, but if you make the person bleed it’s an extra two minutes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829966.jpg">

6. In USAG club Gymnastics, your sports bra and panties must be either nude or the color of your competition leotard, or else you get a couple tenths off your score.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2016/10/01/051200/85154567/1.jpg">

7. In Formula 1 drivers cannot substantially change their helmet designs as of this year.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829968.jpg">

8. In Australia, if the grand final game is tied at full time they come back and play it all over again the following week. Overtime isn’t an option.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829969.jpg">

9. Golfers have to sign their scorecard and if there’s a mistake they are disqualified, even though their score is being kept by others for the entire duration of the game.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829970.jpg">

10. In Soccer, if you take off your shoe to throw it and hit the ball, it counts as a handball.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829963.jpg">

11. In chess there is a rule that a woman has lost a game if she has too much cleavage showing. If her opponent claims this happens, there is a jury who will decide whether the woman has too much cleavage showing or not.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829962.jpg">

12. In the NFL, if you fumble the ball in the opponent’s endzone and it goes out-of-bounds, it’s their ball on the 20 yard line. If you fumble the ball on the one yard line and it goes out-of-bounds, it’s still your ball on the one yard line.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829972.jpg">

13. The actual soccer rule book explains, that there may be no tree on the field.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829973.jpg">

14. In hockey, if a player hits the puck and it goes over the glass without touching anything, it’s a two minute penalty. But, if the puck clears the glass after touching the glass, there is no penalty.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829974.jpg">

15. In golf, you can be watching on TV, call in, and point out a rules violation, thereby getting the golfer disqualified.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829975.jpg">

16. In roller derby, if you fall and someone trips over you, you get a low block penalty.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829976.jpg">

17. In water polo, if you block a shot out of bounds, your team gets the ball, the opposite of almost every ball-centric sports.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/84829978.jpg">

18. Catching the snitch grants 150 points. What’s the point of even trying to score if you get so many points for the snitch?

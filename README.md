## <a href="#link5" id="link4">18 Fascinating Photos Collected From History</a>
1. At the ripe age of 137, White Wolf a.k.a. Chief John Smith is considered the oldest Native American to have ever lived, 1785-1922
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85329747.jpg">

2. A Ghost Army trooper paints an inflatable rubber tank modeled on an M-4 Sherman. The 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, an elite force whose specialty was tactical deception, was a matter of military secrecy until its declassification in 1996.

Military deception is as old as war itself, but the idea the Allied planners came up with represented something new: a mobile, self-contained deception unit capable of staging multimedia illusions on demand. The 1,100 men in the unit were capable of simulating two full divisions—up to 30,000 men—with all the tanks and artillery that the real units might be expected to have. The illusion might discourage the enemy from exploiting a weak spot by making the site seem as if it was heavily defended, or could draw enemy troops away from where real American units were planning an attack.

3. Inflatable dummy tanks and trucks set up near the Rhine River in Germany. Attention to detail was critical. Bulldozers were used to make tank tracks leading up to where the 93 lb (42 kg) inflatable dummies stood. Real artillery shells were tossed around fake guns.

11. American troops prepare nazi Major General Anton Dostler for execution for killing 15 OSS men, Italy, 1945.

German General Anton Dostler is tied to a stake before his execution by a firing squad in the Aversa stockade. The General was convicted and sentenced to death by an American military tribunal after ordering the execution of 15 US soldiers on 26th March 1944.
General Anton Dostler was a general of the infantry in the regular German Army during World War II. In the first Allied war trial after the war, Dostler was found guilty of war crimes and executed by firing squad. He ordered and oversaw the unlawful execution of fifteen captured U.S. soldiers. The soldiers were sent behind the German lines with orders to demolish a tunnel that was being used by the German army as a supply route to the front lines. They were captured and upon learning of their mission, Dostler ordered their execution without trial. The U.S. soldiers were wearing proper military uniforms and carried no civilian or enemy clothing and were in compliance with Hague Convention to be considered non-combatants after their surrender. Under the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, it was legal to execute “spies and saboteurs” disguised in civilian clothes or enemy uniforms but excluded those who were captured in proper uniforms. Since fifteen U.S. soldiers were properly dressed in U.S. uniforms behind enemy lines and not disguised in civilian clothes or enemy uniforms, they were not to be treated as spies but prisoners of war, which Dostler violated. This order was an implementation of Hitler’s secret Commando Order of 1942, which required the immediate execution without trial of commandos and saboteurs.

14. Patty Hearst Robbing the Sunset District branch of the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco at 9:40 A.M. April 15, 1974. Her and the Symbionese Liberation Army (S.L.A.) were in the bank for 4min.

Patricia Hearst Shaw, is the granddaughter of American publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. She became nationally known for events following her 1974 kidnapping while she was a 19-year-old student living in Berkeley, California. Hearst was abducted by a left-wing terrorist group known as the Symbionese Liberation Army. After being isolated and threatened with death, she became supportive of their cause, making propaganda announcements for them and taking part in illegal activities. Hearst was found 19 months after her kidnapping, by which time she was a fugitive wanted for serious crimes. She was held in custody, despite speculation that her family’s resources would prevent her spending time in jail. At her trial, the prosecution suggested that she had joined the Symbionese Liberation Army of her own volition, and sexual activities between her and SLA members had not amounted to rape. She was found guilty of bank robbery. Hearst’s sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter, and she was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">15 Interesting Facts About Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion</a>
1. After 45 years of owning the legendary property, Hugh Hefner is now a renter. Last August he sold the grounds via his Playboy Enterprises to private equity investor Daren Metropolis for $100 million. The catch? Hefner can lease it for $1 million a month.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199427.jpg">

2. Before buying the Playboy Mansion for $1 million in 1971, Hugh Hefner took over a Chicago mansion in 1959, making it the original Playboy compound. He gave it an indoor pool and a bedroom/office with a 100-inch diameter bed, and Playboy models and nightclub employees could rent rooms for $50 a month. No male visitors were allowed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199428.jpg">

3. In late March of 2015 Playboy.com came out with an article that detailed secret underground tunnels that ran from the properties of famous regulars like Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson and James Caan. If it sounds too crazy too be true, it was. On April 1st of 2015, Hef revealed that it was an April Fools’ joke.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199429.jpg">

4. Hefner is quite the art aficionado, and the Mansion proves it with its impressive art gallery. However, one Beatle wasn’t really a fan. While visiting in the 1970s, John Lennon allegedly got a little too drunk and put out a cigarette on a piece of work by Henri Matisse. Those paintings go for millions, by the way. Luckily Hefner was able to restore the art.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199430.jpg">

5. The Mansion has its own zoo license and dozens of pets roaming the grounds, so it only makes sense that there is actually a final resting place for animals. Several of Hef’s dogs have been buried there, as well as multiple monkeys and over 50 varieties of birds.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199431.jpg">

6. Stephen Baldwin once told a story about him and Robert Downey, Jr. on a Mission to hang out with Playmates in the mansion’s wine cellar. He said they were descending down a spiral staircase, and when Downey reached the third-to-last step, he warned Baldwin not to put his foot on it because there was a silent alarm. It’s thought that the feature dated back all the way to 1927 when the cellar held the illegal booze during Prohibition.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199432.jpg">

7. Luke Wilson told the press in 2006 that he actually got “DNAed” from the Mansion staff, which means he was labeled as a “Do Not Admit.” He claimed a Mansion employee asked who he was bringing into the party one night, and Wilson lied and said it was his brother, Owen. In reality it was just a friend, and when they found out he was denied entry for 18 months.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199433.jpg">

8. The Mansion was such a cushy place to stay that several famous guests actually just ended up moving in. James Caan stayed there for a bit in the 1970s, as well as Tony Curtis and Shel Silverstein.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199434.jpg">

9. Hefner has an in-house biographer named Steve Martinez. He’s a full-time archivist whose job it is to maintain the three thousand volumes of scrapbooks in the Mansion’s library. He collects photos and information during the week and on the weekends Hefner helps him update the books. They go back all the way to portraits of Hefner at six months old, and Martinez has instructions to fill the final volumes with Hef’s obituaries.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199435.jpg">

10. The grotto has quite the reputation of quite the cesspool of… bacteria. In April 2011 it was actually a problem. 123 people who attended a fundraiser party got really sick, and health officials found the bacteria that causes Legionnaire’s disease in the water.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199436.jpg">

11. It takes a whopping 80 full-time employees to maintain the grounds, cook, provide security, and maintain electrical and plumbing services.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199437.jpg">

12. There is a giant statue of Frankenstein’s monster that guests hang out with in the Great Room while waiting for the festivities to get started.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199438.jpg">

13. When Hefner can’t be at a party or dinner, you can usually find a life-size cardboard hanging around the crowd.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199439.jpg">

14. Hustler founder Larry Flynt wanted to buy the Mansion this year, to convert it into the (you guessed it) “Hustler Mansion.” It’s unclear whether he actually made an offer, but Flynt made it clear that if he were to buy it, Hefner would not be allowed to remain in the home.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85199440.jpg">

15. The Mansion has regularly-scheduled movie nights, and they’re serious business. Hefner, being the giant movie buff that he is, has a board of friends that curate titles for screenings. He invites people over to watch them, but he’s got a zero-tolerance policy on disruptions. Mike Tyson attended one of these events, and he fell asleep. He didn’t hear his phone ringing nonstop while he was snoozing, so he was never invited to movie night again.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">15 People Share The Moment They Knew Their Partner Was Cheating</a>
1. Our Dropboxes merged when I had logged on to mine on his computer and I found a folder named “Specialist” full of naked photographs of all the women he had been sleeping with for the previous 8 years. Apparently he needed access to them wherever he was. And was stupid enough to have the icons be a photo from inside the folder.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431414.jpg">

2. My best friend lived in the family’s old vacation trailer behind his house (back in the 90’s). I arrived with a twelve-pack, opened the door and there was my girlfriend. She was standing full frontal (not a stitch on) and he was in his boxers. Later he told me “Nothing happened.” J. D. Salinger had a term for that kind of guy, it was… PHONY.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431415.jpg">

3. My insurance agent emailed me. I was on a deployment, and my now ex-wife and my former friend drunkenly wrapped my car around a light-pole. My agent (I know him from college, he was at the wedding) happened to see the two being overly familiar at a bar, the same day as the date on the insurance claim.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431416.jpg">

4. I picked up his phone to change the channel on Chromecast. It unlocked and opened the Messenger app where he was making plans with my roommate to hook up while I was at work the next day.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431417.jpg">

5. She had a number of alternate Facebook pages under pseudonyms. One day, one of them showed up on my “suggested friends” and I said “Hey, this girl looks a lot like SO.” So, I looked at it. Sure enough, it was her, and she had an active relationship going on with someone else.
I later found two more of these pages.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431422.jpg">

6. Came home from working a double shift and found the toilet seat up. Either my wife didn’t take a piss for 20 hours straight or there had been another man in my house.
Suspected it was her “gay” friend from work. I also knew that said friend was trying to sell his house, so I called the real estate agent and asked the see his place. Right inside the front door, i recognized one of her jackets hanging in the mud room. Proceeded to the living room and bam…right on the fucking mantel was a picture of my wife and this guy.
We divorced shortly after. She ended up marrying this guy…then cheated on him…and now they are divorced. Didn’t feel bad for him at all.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431423.jpg">

7. Was the night of her company Christmas party. I had to stay home and babysit our five year old son (Grandma was supposed to, but she fell and was in the hospital with a broken hip.)
I figured wife would go and then come home early. Turns out, she was planning to stay the night at a hotel so “she could drink and not worry about driving.”
I woke up about 3am just knowing something was wrong (never happened before) and checked “Find My Phone” to see where she was. She was with her boss at his apartment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431420.jpg">

8. He took a job up north because it paid really well. 6 – 12 months, tops. Then he would come home and we’d buy a house together and get married. We had been together for 3 years at this point.
It was hard, doing the long distance thing. We talked on the phone every night. One night I called his room
“Hello?” Female voice. My heart sank.
“Uh. Um. Is Jonathan there?”
“Who’s this?”
“Uh, his fucking girlfriend?!”
She laughed and hung up on me. The end.

10. I was like 17, and the other girl posted pictures of them making out on facebook and tagged me in them. The caption was “having a great time with Smileys boyfriend”… yes she was actually that much of a bitch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431424.jpg">

11. I stopped by his house to surprise him. His bedroom window was open and she was very loud. I tried the front door and it wasn’t locked so I let his dogs in the house (because it would piss him off) and sat on the couch for a few minutes thinking about how much power I had. How I could burst in and do anything… I wrote goodbye on his white board and left.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431418.jpg">

12. He was fixing something on my computer and I was looking on. Phone was on the table next to me. It buzzed. I said “Hey, your phone just buzzed, you have a new… update from Tinder?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85431425.jpg">

13. He went to nyc on a business trip and his phone was constantly going straight to voicemail whenever i called. when i finally got in touch with him he said that he was having a hard time getting a signal… in midtown. so i called his office and asked for him and they were totally confused. it turns out he was in another state visiting someone he met on the internet.

15. We hadn’t slept together yet. I wanted to wait. Told her from the beginning. Said we could take our time and she was alright with that.
She wasn’t.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">16 Unsettling Facts Burdened with Too Much Knowledge</a>
1. Chucky from Child's Play is based on a real doll that is said to be cursed and cause violent mishaps. The doll was named Eugene and said to be given to Robert Otto in 1903 by someone who worked at the family's estate who was well-versed in voodoo and wanted to get back at them. The doll was said to rearrange furniture, destroy toys, and move freely. It is currently housed in Key West, Florida.

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">Gamer Finds Craigslist Gold!</a>
1. "I had an Amiga 2000 HD back in college in the early 90s and was hoping to find a small Amiga to use again. This was advertised as two Amiga 500 computers, a monitor and some accessories so I went and picked it up.  Was surprised that the computers and monitor were boxed. Here is a snap of everything loaded into my car."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361862.jpg">

2. "Starting to sort through the stuff. Came with some boxed games and various discs."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361863.jpg">

3. More manuals and floppies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361864.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361868.jpg">

8. "Some more stuff. Two Amiga floppies and a generic external drive. Boxed joystick and a funny 3rd party mouse. Also, two unopened boxes of floppies."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361869.jpg">

9. "WHISPER QUIET LOL"

10.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361871.jpg">

11. Can this packaging get any more 80's?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361872.jpg">

12. "These were just lose inside the box. I had the second from the right joystick here -- and it sucked. Cramped up my hand after playing for a little while."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361873.jpg">

13. Amiga Genlock device for overlaying Amiga graphics on top of live video and the Amiga 520 RF modulator.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361880.jpg">

20. Second Amiga, also in great shape. Needs a minor clean only.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361881.jpg">

21. One is slightly more yellowed than the other for some reason.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361882.jpg">

22. "Mitsubishi Multisync monitor AUM-1381A. Need a little bit of a clean but in great shape otherwise. Has a Tilt-Swivel stand in the box which I need to install."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361883.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361885.jpg">

25. "Testing it with my Tandy 1000 EX. Works great with CGA. Reading the review from PC Magazine, it also supports EGA and Monochrome. It can support up to 800x560 resolution so I think it might do VGA too. (Will need to make a new cable.)"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361886.jpg">

26. "Hooked up to the first Amiga. Kickstart 1.3. This machine has 1 meg of RAM. Need to check the trap door to see why the clock isn't there."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361887.jpg">

27. Second Amiga is Kickstart 2.0 and has 1 meg of RAM and a real time clock.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361888.jpg">

28. "Monitor is all cleaned up. I tested this monitor with CGA, EGA, MDA (Monochrome) and Amiga 15khz analog video. All work perfectly! I found some info on it and it also supports 31.5khz VGA (640x480.) It is a real jack of all trades!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361889.jpg">

29. "Inside, it is super clean. It is very odd that the monitor is quite dim for some reason, even at max brightness. Doesn't appear to have many hours of run-time on it. I adjusted the G1 and G2 controls along with sub brightness and R/G/B cut pots. It made a huge difference now."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361890.jpg">

30. "Trying out some random games it came with. Monitor is looking nice now I adjusted it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361891.jpg">

31. "Even under my bright shop lights it is decently bright. If I turn it up more than this it loses a little sharpness in the center from some minor blooming. Considering the age of this monitor and the unknown history, it's in amazing shape. Not a scratch or nick on it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361892.jpg">

32. "I have the original Deluxe Paint III floppies including the art disc. It was a real nostalgic blast to look at the old classic files like Venus and King Tut."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361893.jpg">

33. "Opening up the computer with the non working clock, it has the Commodore A501 RAM+clock board. It is encased in metal shielding so I cut that away to get inside."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361894.jpg">

34. Yep, here is your problem! Ouch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361895.jpg">

35. "The corrosion ate away a bunch of the copper but luckily it is just ground fill and one trace for the battery which doesn't do anything. I cleaned it as best I could with alcohol and a brush. Hopefully it won't corrode any more."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361896.jpg">

36. "The original battery is a rechargeable NiCD 3.6v -- so the board tries to recharge the battery when powered up. I replaced the battery with a salvaged CR2032 holder and battery and installed a diode to prevent charging of this lithium battery. The clock appears to work perfectly with the 2.9 volts it gets from this CR2032 after diode voltage drop."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361897.jpg">

37. Card installed back into the trap door compartment, without the metal shielding.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361898.jpg">

38. "All set! Here is Kickstart 1.3 machine (with repaired A501 board) all hooked up on my workbench. Awesome! AMIGA FOREVER!"

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">Guy Leaves His Apartment During Construction and Comes Back to Gigantic Mess</a>
1. About 4 weeks ago I got a notice that there would be some construction work done in the apartment I live in. I got a letter telling me that the construction workers will need access to all apartments on saturday, June 24th and monday, June 26th. My landlord collected all security keys, so the workers could access the apartments in the event that nobody is there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85392998.png">

So I made the dumbest mistake I could make: I left my apartment. This is the picture I took about 5 days prior, June 19th. It shows my shelf the way I left it before I left my apartment, I don't really touch the game wall because I have no reason to. I'm more of a collector than an active gamer, and once I finished something, I put it in my shelf for it to look good. I want to point out the Majoras Mask 3DS, which is worth around 300-500€."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85392999.jpg">

2. I left my apartment on Saturday at 12:40 pm  because all the construction noise was getting on my nerves.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85393000.jpg">

I briefly returned the next day, Sunday, to get some things, when I noticed something weird about my shelf. Something was missing. I was joking around with my boyfriend that they'll probably rob me, I didn't actually believe they would.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85393001.jpg">

They handpicked a single game from my collection, probably thinking I wouldn't notice it. They targeted GTAV before, because they swapped places with REZ Infinite - too bad for them that it was an empty box. But Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 seemed to do the job just fine, given it was still wrapped and unopened since I bought it.

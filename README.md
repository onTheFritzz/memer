## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Guy Leaves His Apartment During Construction and Comes Back to Gigantic Mess</a>
1. About 4 weeks ago I got a notice that there would be some construction work done in the apartment I live in. I got a letter telling me that the construction workers will need access to all apartments on saturday, June 24th and monday, June 26th. My landlord collected all security keys, so the workers could access the apartments in the event that nobody is there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85392998.png">

So I made the dumbest mistake I could make: I left my apartment. This is the picture I took about 5 days prior, June 19th. It shows my shelf the way I left it before I left my apartment, I don't really touch the game wall because I have no reason to. I'm more of a collector than an active gamer, and once I finished something, I put it in my shelf for it to look good. I want to point out the Majoras Mask 3DS, which is worth around 300-500€."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85392999.jpg">

2. I left my apartment on Saturday at 12:40 pm  because all the construction noise was getting on my nerves.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85393000.jpg">

I briefly returned the next day, Sunday, to get some things, when I noticed something weird about my shelf. Something was missing. I was joking around with my boyfriend that they'll probably rob me, I didn't actually believe they would.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85393001.jpg">

They handpicked a single game from my collection, probably thinking I wouldn't notice it. They targeted GTAV before, because they swapped places with REZ Infinite - too bad for them that it was an empty box. But Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 seemed to do the job just fine, given it was still wrapped and unopened since I bought it.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">24 Facts That Could Save Your Life</a>
1. If you are in a foreign country and need to call for help, but don't know the emergency number, call 112. It's the international emergency number and will automatically connect you to the nearest help line.

2. If you ever feel like someone is following your car take four right turns and eventually it will make a circle. If they are still behind you that means they are following you. Don't drive home, just call the police and drive to the police station.

3. If a tornado looks like it's not moving, it's actually moving towards you.

4. If a service dog ever approaches you without its owner, follow them and do it quickly because potentially you can save someone else's life.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312632.jpg">

5. If someone ever tries to grab you, scratch them. Their DNA will now be in your nails.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312637.jpg">

6. If you're ever buried in an avalanche, spit. Your saliva will follow the gravity and you can simply dig the opposite way.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312638.jpg">

7. If you ever wake up in the middle of the night to the smell of gas, do NOT turn on the light. A spark from a light switch could blow up the entire house.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312639.jpg">

8. If you accidentally disturb a beehive or wasp nest, do not run for the water. They'll wait for you to resurface and continue stinging you. Just run fast and as far as you can, because eventually, they will stop following you.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312640.jpg">

9. The more colorful and vivid the animal is the more likely it's poisonous and you probably shouldn't eat it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312641.jpg">

10. Everyone hates red eyes in photos. But if your pupils reflect white in a picture, it could be a sign that something is seriously wrong with your eyes, such as cataract, retina problems, or even eye cancer.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312642.jpg">

11. If you are ever being chased by a polar bear get completely naked and drop your clothes on the ground as you run away. Polar bears have really bad ADD and will firmly inspect your clothes before chasing you again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312643.jpg">

12. If someone gets stabbed, do not take the knife out. It acts as a plug to the hole and prevents blood loss. Apply pressure to the wound and call the police.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312644.jpg">

13. Wolves will only attack you if they can intimidate you into running away from them. Standing your ground against a wolf pack will be terrifying but eventually, they will leave you alone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312645.jpg">

14. The machine that sets the pins at the bowling alley is extremely dangerous. So if you slide into the pins as a joke, there is a very good chance that you will be crushed to death.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312646.jpg">

15. If you ever for some reason ingest windshield wiper fluid or anti-freeze, drink large amounts of vodka to keep it from shredding your kidneys to give you time to get to the hospital.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312647.jpg">

16. If you ever get carjacked and they tell you to drive, crash the car into the nearby road or intersection. Most likely they won't be wearing their seatbelts. So when you crash the car they will get injured and you can take this chance to get out of the car and run like hell.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312648.jpg">

17. If your house smells like fish for absolutely no reason, 9 times out of 10 it means that there is an electrical fire.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312633.jpg">

18. Lying flat on your back is the best way to survive a falling elevator.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312649.jpg">

19. If you ever fall off of the edge of the subway platform and onto the tracks don't waste your time trying crawl back up. There is a crawl space built to go underneath in case this happens.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312650.jpg">

20. If a deer is running across the road it's better to hit it than swerve and run into a ditch. If there is a moose in the middle of the road swerve and run into a ditch. Hitting a moose is like running into a brick wall.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312651.jpg">

21. Have you ever been told that if an alligator is chasing you that you should run in a zigzag? Well, contrary to popular belief, alligators actually aren't stupid and they can run up to 35 miles per hour. So just run straight and run like hell.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312652.jpg">

22. You can always dial 911 if you have no bars because, in an emergency, your phone will connect to any nearby cell tower as long as it has a battery in it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312653.jpg">

23. If you ever get stuffed in the back of a trunk disconnect the brake light wires so when the cop pulls them over you can kick the door so people know you are there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312654.jpg">

24. If you ever need to escape a moving car do not jump out, put one foot down and take a step. This will significantly reduce your speed and will have a much greater chance of surviving the fall.

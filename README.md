## <a href="#link1" id="link0">Pulitzer Prize Winning Photographs: Part Two</a>
1. 1986:  Tom Gralish – “Philadelphia’s Homeless.”  In winter of 1985 Gralish visited the city’s homeless and encountered Walter.  “I like any kind of food,” said Walter.  Whatever’s there.  Hotdog one day, the next Chinese food, roast beef sandwich…”
Walter lives on a sidewalk heating grate and is one of those guys who is hard to reach because he talks to himself and rants to people on the street.  Everyone knows him; people who live and work in the neighborhood give him change.  Eventually, Walter allowed Gralish to photograph him.  “People like it when you pay attention to them.  These guys had disdain for society and the rules, that’s why they objected to the shelters.  They saw themselves as the last free men.”

3. 1988:  Scott Shaw – “Baby Jessica.”  October 14, 1987: Left alone briefly in her aunt’s Midland, Texas, backyard while her mother went inside to answer the phone, 18-month-old Jessica McClure fell into an abandoned 22-foot-deep well.
Firemen, paramedics, and a cadre of drillers struggled to reach her as the town of Midland immediately united for the mission. A fledgling CNN picked up local TV station KMID’s video feed of Baby Jessica’s rescue, and the story became the first live round-the-clock news event, garnering an immense worldwide audience.
Three days into the rescue, paramedic Robert O’Donnell (who was claustrophobic) wriggled down a parallel shaft dug 28 feet down and through a tunnel to come up under Baby Jessica. But her leg, pinned above her head, held  her firmly in place, and O’Donnell couldn’t budge her. Inch by inch, with some patience and K-Y Jelly slathered over the well walls, O’Donnell pulled Jessica free. He handed her to a fireman who wrapped her onto a board and lifted her safely back up into the world, 58 hours after her fall.

4. 1989:  Ron Olshwanger – “Rescue Attempt.”  Olshwanger captured an image of St Louis firefighter Adam Long giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the limp form of 2 year old Patricia Pettus as he rushed her from a burning apartment on Dec 30, 1988.
The next day, as she clung to life at St. Louis Children's Hospital, the photo ran on the front page of the Post-Dispatch. Before long, it was published in newspapers worldwide, and chronicled a moment that would change fire safety standards around the world.
Six days after the fire, Patricia died. The following spring, Olshwanger was presented the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for spot news photography.
As for Long, the incident branded him a hero — he received a Medal of Honor — though he didn't feel very heroic. "For about a year, I second-guessed myself: 'Did I really do all that I could have done?'" Long said.
The two men grieved when she died. They attended her funeral together.
And as difficult as it was to accept her loss, each found meaning in her death.
"The little girl did not die in vain," said Olshwanger, who said he still receives requests for copies of the photo. "To me, she is a hero because people are going out and buying smoke detectors because of what they see in that photo."
The fire also sparked a friendship between Olshwanger and Long that has remained strong for over 20 years.

8. 1994:  Kevin Carter – “Vulture and Child.”  Carter traveled to Sudan to cover the relentless East African famine.  He found people so weakened by hunger that they were dying at the rate of 20 per hour.
Carter found a young girl trying to make her way to a feeding station and readied his camera.  Suddenly, a vulture landed nearby.  Carter took the photo before chasing the bird away.  Afterward, he sat under a tree and cried.
The picture ran in newspapers worldwide, and Carter received outraged letters and angry phone calls demanding to know why he didn’t pick up the child.  But journalists in Sudan were told not to touch the famine victims because of the risk of disease transmission.  This was no comfort to Carter, who later told a friend, “I’m really, really sorry I didn’t pick the child up.”  The controversy and other personal problems overwhelmed him.  On July 16, 1994, police found Carter dead in an apartment of an apparent suicide.  He was 33 years old.

In September 1994, U.S. Troops landed in Haiti to help return Aristide to power.  In Port-Au-Prince there was a joyous democracy march.  Then someone threw a grenade into the crowd.  People were killed and wounded.  There was shooting, but no one could figure out where it was coming from.  During the chaos, Guzy captured the above image showing a man on the ground with his arm raised.  The crowd thought he had thrown the grenade and were trying to attack him.  Two U.S. Troops were trying to protect him.

They were trying to flee, to go deeper into the bush.  They were forced back by the troops into Rwanda.  the group is led by a handful of militia guys.  Men who are the leaders in the communities.  They may or may not be wanted for genocide.”

Elian’s U.S. based relatives lost a bitter legal battle with U.S. officials to prevent Elian from being returned to his father in Cuba.  The Gonzalez family allowed photographer Alan Diaz to wait for the raid with Dalrymple and the boy.

15. 2002:  On the morning of Sep 11, 2001, freelance photographer Steve Ludlum was walking along the Brooklyn waterfront when he saw black smoke pouring from the North Tower of the World Trade Center on the other side of the river.  Ludlum ran home for his camera and found a friend to drive him to the Manhattan Bridge.
Ludlum rested his zoom lens on the iron railing and adjusted his camera.  As he was adjusting the camera, United Airlines Flight 175 was headed toward the South Tower.  He didn’t see the plane hit, but a ball of fire appeared in his viewfinder.  Ludlum released the shutter, thinking all the while it was a bomb.
Ludlum’s usual photo lab was too busy, so he went to a one hour drugstore service.  Ninety minutes later Ludlum went to the New York Times with his film.
The New York Times staff photographers were among the first to arrive at the World Trade Center.  Because communications were disrupted, The Times editors had no way of knowing if their photographers were alive.  After risking their lives to record the destruction of the World Trade Center, they fought through smoke and falling debris to deliver their film to the Times.  Ludlum’s photograph was submitted as part of the Times’ portfolio.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">30 Major Life Traps To Avoid</a>
1. Just because you have spare money at the end of the month doesn’t mean you need to spend it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319012.jpg">

2. Comparing yourself to others. Comparison is the thief of joy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319018.jpg">

3. Thinking that you're running out of time to do something because someone else has done it already.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319019.jpg">

4. Marrying or living with or otherwise committing to someone who is mean to you and doesn’t treat you well.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319020.jpg">

5. Waiting too long for "perfect," like the perfect soulmate, house, job, etc., and then letting too many good opportunities pass by.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319013.jpg">

6. Obsession with physical appearance. This has plagued my life and I’ve never felt satisfied with how I look. Be kind to yourself and others.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319021.jpg">

7. Doing nothing becouse of fear of rejection.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319022.jpg">

8. Having an elaborate expensive wedding that does nothing but stress everyone out and bankrupt you.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319023.jpg">

9. Having kids bc society said you should. Nothing against kids, parents, etc, but the pressure to have kids is immense in most areas.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319024.jpg">

10. Staying in unhealthy relationships because "I've put ten years into this." I beg of you, know your worth.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319025.jpg">

11. You gotta be your own advocate. If you think other people will fix the problems you have, you're gonna have a bad time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319026.jpg">

12. Lifestyle creep. Feeling the need to upgrade cars, houses, jewelry, etc to keep up with your peers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319015.jpg">

13. Putting things off. We could do it more as kids because someone was there to pick up the slack, or stay on top of you to get something done. But as an adult, the consequences of waiting on stuff slaps you hard.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319027.jpg">

14. Multi-level marketing. Someone got me to go to a seminar and the rhetoric was what a lot of people want to hear about themselves for validation.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319028.jpg">

15. Never letting go of the past , that can kill you I swear.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319016.jpg">

16. Payday loans.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319029.jpg">

17. Spending more because you're earning more.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319030.jpg">

18. Alcoholism and drug abuse. Eventually getting high stops being fun, but you can't stop because your body is physically dependent on it. It sucks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319031.jpg">

19. Letting other people define success for you rather than defining it for yourself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319032.jpg">

20. Imposter Syndrome. The cure is eventually realizing no one has a clue.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319034.jpg">

21. Sunk cost fallacy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319035.jpg">

22. Always staying in your comfort zone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319036.jpg">

23. My grandfather only ever gave me one piece of advice. "There are 3 things in life that can ruin you. Don't do drugs, Don't gamble, and a good women is very important, a bad one can ruin your life forever." All I can say is too true.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319037.jpg">

24. Simply graduating from college will guarantee you a nice paying comfy job.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319038.jpg">

25. Working a job you hate because it pays well but you’re miserable.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319039.jpg">

26. One of the biggest traps in life is not picking yourself up after a failure. Letting yourself go and sinking to the bottom. Depression will sink in and you’ll start to loose everything. Extremely heartbreaking when you see someone you love go through this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319040.jpg">

27. Procrastination.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319041.jpg">

28. Not knowing how to use credit cards correctly.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319042.jpg">

29. Toxic relationships. People do them to try and "fix" people, but they just end up getting themselves hurt.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319043.jpg">

30. Letting regret and fear control you.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319045.jpg">

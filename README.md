## <a href="#link8" id="link7">A Mysterious Box In Grandfather’s Attic Unlocked A 200-Year-Old Secret</a>
1. A few weeks ago, the Lopez family decide to clean their grandfather's attic.

They expected to find some memories of the past, but they couldn't have bargained for what they stumbled upon.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080865.jpg">

2. But to understand this story, you need a bit of context.

When they were children, the grandfather would tell them stories about his father, Ernesto Lopez. According to him, Ernesto had found the pirate Jose Gaspar's treasure in the Hillsborough River.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080866.jpg">

3. They'd always dismissed it as legend -- until they found a box in the attic.

Jose Gaspar was a notorious (and very real) Spanish pirate. Though they knew he was an actual person, they could have never assumed their great-grandfather got ahold of his treasure -- but then recently, they found the box.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080867.jpg">

4. So what was inside?

For starters, they found a crude map of Tampa, likely drawn years ago.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080868.jpg">

5. Here's a drawing of Jose Gaspar, taken from a 1900 brochure.

But the unearthed treasures were about to get even better.

6. Yup: They found old Portuguese and Spanish coins, likely from the 1700s.

Visits to numerous antique stores in the area revealed that these coins are the real deal.

7. Finding real, centuries-old treasure is exciting in and of itself.

But what's that at the top of the box? Could it be what it actually looks like?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080871.jpg">

8. That's right, it's a preserved human hand wearing a ring.

Why their great-grandfather would keep that, they may never know.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080872.jpg">

9. The Lopez family is still trying to make sense of it all.

"Either my great-grandfather made the best, most elaborate pirate hoax ever and never shared it with anyone or he really did find some treasure on the Hillsborough River. There's really no way to know which is the case," Maria Lopez said in an interview.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080873.jpg">

10. No matter the truth, it's a pretty amazing thing to find in an attic.

It also reminds us all that you never know what might be hiding in storage -- so don't just assume it's all dusty Christmas decorations. You could be sitting on a literal treasure!

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">28 Restaurant Secrets From Insiders that  Most Customers Don't Know</a>
1. Arbys roast beef is a compressed block of beef scraps. the block of scraps comes sitting in a bag of beef  broth and is warmed until it's ready to be served.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/15/123257/87305301/Beef.jpg">

2. I worked in a fancy country club ($25K initiation fee, then $7K/year in the 90s). A slice of "homemade" cheesecake was $7 each on the menu. One of the sous chefs stopped by the Giant Food grocery store every day on the way to work to pickup a whole cheesecake for about $5.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300118.jpg">

3. Ice machines are RARELY cleaned out. Like almost NEVER. Bugs, dirt, food particles, whatever. At two previous restaurant jobs, I felt bad that customers were getting gross ice (both places had a single machine) and mentioned it to my managers at the time. They both brushed it off as having better things to do with my time, so I used to "accidentally" kick the plug out of the wall in the evenings, come in the next day, and find a half-melted ice machine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300120.jpg">

I was stuck cleaning it, but it was worth it since I felt better about the ice being served. We had to use ice from the store down the street for the rest of the day, but it wasn't like it cost the restaurants much money. One bartender told me he would "accidentally" drop/break a glass into an ice machine to serve the same purpose if the management wasn't being cool about it. Broken glass = scoop out and dump all the ice, and might as well clean the thing since it's empty.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300123.jpg">

4. Back when I was a fry cook, some customers thought they were being slick and would order unsalted fries to make sure they got fresh ones. Us cooks would just put already salted fries back into the fryer to wash the salt off.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300121.jpg">

5. Veggie burgers were grilled on the same grill as the meat, and were often cooked in the grease of other burgers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300122.jpg">

6. Maybe not a "secret secret" but just not something people realized.At Wendy's, the cooked burgers that don't get sold, those go into a pot in a refrigerator, and they get made into TOMORROW's chili.The crispy chicken that doesn't get sold today? Those go into a pot in the fridge and those get made into TOMORROW's crispy chicken salads.Back when Wendy's had a salad bar ... the burger buns that are going stale at the end of a day? Those got made into tomorrow's garlic bread on the salad bar.None of this is unsafe, all of this is approved by the department of health, and none of this is a trade secret ... but I bet you didn't realize that.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300124.jpg">

7. Papa John's employees are always high. Always.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300125.jpg">

8. Ex Starbucks barista.-  All the pastries come frozen and we defrost them. We think they're overpriced too, don't complain about the price, if it's too expensive for you then Starbucks is not the place for you. Everything is overpriced here, DD is cheaper and even cheaper is just going to the grocery store-Lots of syrups are made with milk and/or honey so they're not vegan; this is problematic for customers who pay extra for soy milk because they want to avoid animal products-Cleanliness and freshness really depends on the individual location.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300126.jpg">

I worked at a 24/7 location with some of the highest traffic in the US (comparable to Times Square Starbucks) and I assure you that hardly anything was properly sanitized and things were not always fresh. We tried but it's very hard to keep up with cleaning and such when you have 50 customers in line and people yelling at you wondering where their drink is-If you're rude, and chances are you might get decaf shots. Cause f**k you. Or if you're rude and you order a skinny drink someone might use real syrup (may it go straight to your a*s, b***h!)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300127.jpg">

But no one would ever do anything other than this pettiness, it would be super f****d up to actually ruin someone's drink or make it gross-If it's rush hour and you ask for a complicated drink, we hate you-We're supposed to regularly check, and log the temperatures of the milk carafes that are available for customers to use but we get so busy that the milk usually has been sitting out for hours, rising above safe temperatures.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300128.jpg">

The ice machines are probably nasty. I don't think we ever cleaned ours in my 2 years there-Iced coffees and iced teas are automatically sweetened using "simple syrup." You can switch to another syrup free of charge or ask for fewer pumps of syrup if you prefer it unsweetened. We are supposed to sanitize the foaming nozzle between drinks; the container holding the sanitizing agent gets super nasty very quickly from all the milk but it doesn't get switched often-During rush hour, baristas often leave the milk jugs out rather than return it to the fridge between use because you're pouring milk literally every 30 seconds. Unfortunately, this means the milk temperature rises above safe levels and bacterial growth duplicates-Please don't order a special "secret menu" drink. There is no secret f*****g menu.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300129.jpg">

Tell us what strips you want in it and we can make it but if you just tell us a ridiculous name (snickers crunch frappuccino!) chances are we have no clue how to make that and we probably will make it up. It probably will end up tasting fine anyways.. Unless you're used to having it made one way and suddenly someone makes it up using different ingredients-When you approach the cashier, put down your phone and know what you want to order. Be polite, not rude! It's crazy how many times people come up and are like "hold on, I'm getting a drink for my friend, let me call her real quick." Um no.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300130.jpg">

9. We buy tiny wine bottles for $7 and sell for $37. Spaghetti Factories house wine is Franzia box wine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300131.jpg">

10. The only thing that is fresh and healthy, not pre-made, bagged and/or frozen at like all fast food places. Is the tomatoes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300132.jpg">

11. Health inspection is really kind of a sham. Health inspectors tend to inspect all the restaurants in an area around the same time. When the inspector shows up at one restaurant the manager will typically notify the other restaurants in the area.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300119.jpg">

I worked at Taco Bell. When we got a call from the BK down the street that the health inspector was there, we knew he would be showing up at our place sometime in the next week. We would call in extra people to do a deep cleaning of everything. It did not matter that most of the year every time we hosed out under the fryer or food prep lines, we drowned hundreds of roaches. When the health inspector showed up everything was clean, so we still had a 100% on our health inspection.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300133.jpg">

12. I work at Taco Bell, and you DO NOT want to see how the meat comes into the store. The meat we use for the tacos and other things of the sort comes in big plastic bags labeled "Suitable for human consumption". They smell absolutely awful until we put the seasonings in. Yeah, don't go to Taco Bell.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300134.jpg">

13. Not gonna say which chain but the one i used to work at was very clean and well managed. The only real secret we had was...well... Nobody was drinking the sodas they thought they were. We didn't use regular syrup in the fountain machines. If you ordered a coke, you got "panda cola". If you ordered a 7-up you got "panda lime-up".Sorry...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300135.jpg">

14. I worked at mcdonalds, and the mcrib if left out raw, melts into a liquid
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300136.jpg">

15. Zoup! The Fresh Soup Company: All the soups are frozen. They come in frozen and if there are leftovers at the end of the night they are refrozen and served another day. Pretty standard for fast - casual dining, but I found it unusual considering "fresh soup" is in the name.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300137.jpg">

16. Most of our desserts are purchased from the Wal-Mart directly across the street then marked up 500%. For the price of a couple of pieces of cheesecake, you could just go across the street to Wal-Mart after your meal and buy a whole one.We just drizzle a bit of chocolate or raspberry sauce on it so that it doesn't look exactly like the one from Wal-Mart.Also, a smoker outside the building doesn't mean your barbecue is fresh. Most of it is frozen. Sometimes we just throw logs on there so it looks and smells like we're barbecuing. Homey, we made that shit two days ago. That's just wood you're smelling.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300138.jpg">

17. My brother services coffee machines in restaurants. Never, *EVER* get coffee from McDonalds.Ever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300139.jpg">

18. Candy man here. We left chocolate out in display cases for months on end. When my friends came by to the store I told them to avoid it at all costs.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300140.jpg">

19. I saw a cook at Ihop f**k up an omelet and put the wrong sauce on it, he just washed it off in the sink and than tossed it back on the grill.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300143.jpg">

20. Whenever we have ingredients that is going to expire or just expired, we tell our cashiers to subtly "promote" certain foods when a customer seems unsure about what to buy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300144.jpg">

21. At KFC, we were supposed to change the fryer oil every couple days. Our penny-pinching manager had us change it every couple weeks. We'd just skim off the 'floaters' and cover it at night.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300145.jpg">

22. I worked at a fried chicken joint during my teenage years. The owner refused to let us throw away chicken pieces that have gone bad to where you'd gagged if you smell them.We battered them up, fried em and served them to unsuspecting customers.

1. My attention span.

3. I think the internet just amplified everything humans do, both good and bad.Like music? Here's a few million aspiring artists, some of which have a few dozen followers at most, have fun! Like art? Here's thousands of drawing every day. Like murdering people and lighting buildings on fire? Here's hundreds of tips on how to do it!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275651.jpg">

8. Romantic relationships. People on social media spread oodles of toxicity and make you overthink every little thing, it’s insane.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275663.jpg">

15. Conspiracy theories. Used to be something interesting to hear or wonder about. You would randomly or rarely meet an actual conspiracy theorist or see one in a movie. Now everyone has an aunt or uncle or friend who has just gone off the deep end and it’s just sad.

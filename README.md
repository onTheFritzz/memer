## <a href="#link10" id="link9">8 Crazy Experiments From Real Life Mad Scientists</a>
1. Britches :
Britches was a monkey who was torn from his mother and forced into animal testing at the University of California. He was assigned to a project that would test a prototype sonar device for blind people. The only problem is that Britches wasn't blind. The scientists sewed his eyes shut. He was eventually freed by the Animal Liberation Front during a raid in 1985.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126404.jpg">

2. Project MKUltra :
In the 1950s, the CIA's resident scientists began experimenting with mind control, using LSD, electroshock therapy, and the repetition of sound. Most of their findings were destroyed during the Watergate scandal, but there is evidence that the government dosed unsuspecting citizens with drugs to observe them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126405.jpg">

3. Skin Hardening : 
In an effort to make skin tougher for soldiers, Albert Kligman did experiments by using inmates as test subjects. Kligman would inject them with dangerous chemicals, but all his unfortunate test subjects got out of the deal were blisters, burns, and permanent scars.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126406.jpg">

4. The Stanford Prison Experiment :
Subjects were organized into two groups. Some were the "guards" and the others were the "prisoners." Even though they were assigned these roles arbitrarily, the "guards" quickly started displaying sadistic behavior, forcing "prisoners" to strip naked and sleep on the hard concrete. One "prisoner" was dehumanized so much that he had a mental breakdown and was forced to exit the experiment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126407.jpg">

5. The Milgram Obedience Experiment :
Participants in this experiment were told by the experimenter to press a button that would shock another person in the other room. The person being shocked was actually just an actor pretending, but the participant didn't know that. All they were told was that experiment required them to continue shocking this person, upping the voltage until they were motionless. The study found that 65 percent of people would continue shocking the person even after they were screaming in pain. Shocking, right?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126408.jpg">

6. Harlow's Experiments In Isolation :
Rhesus monkeys were torn from their mothers as infants and forced into Harlow's "pit of despair" cage, with only a water bottle to keep them company. The point of the project was to study the effects of isolation on child development and subsequent depression. Not surprisingly, the baby monkeys became depressed. They also developed physical problems like poor digestion. Some even committed suicide by refusing food and water
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126409.jpg">

7. Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment :
The US Public Health Service purposefully injected black male sharecroppers with syphilis in order to study its effects. The effects, of course, were that they would get horrible skin disfigurations and eventually die. It seems the government neglected to treat them after infecting them with the STD. By the way, this went on between 1932 and 1970. That's 40 years! It spanned multiple presidencies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126410.jpg">

8. Criminal Testicle Transplants :
Leo Stanley, head physician of the San Quentin prison in 1913, believed that males who committed crimes had less testosterone than other men, so he would test his theory by giving inmates new testicles. Because of the shortage of human scrotums, sometimes inmates would be fixed with animal balls instead.

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">10 Of The Most Expensive Beers In The World</a>
1. 1. SAPPORO’S SPACE BARLEY
Price: $110/six-pack

This is the first beer coming from space! In 2006, Japanese and Russian scientists rocketed barley seeds to the International Space Station and planted them aboard the Zvezda Service Module. Japanese brewer Sapporo offers the beer made of these seeds which spent 5 months in the space for very reasonable price for a six-pack, having in mind the story.

2. 2. CROWN AMBASSADOR RESERVE – most expensive beers

3. 3. TUTANKHAMUN ALE
Price: $75/500ml

In 1990, Cambridge archaeologist Dr. Barry Kemp found ten brewing chambers buried beneath the Egyptian sand. Scientist Dr. Delwen Samuelanalysedd the residues to quantify the 3,250-year-old recipe! Scottish brewer Jim Merrington offered beer made by this recipe and the first bottle was sold for $7,686, but the price tag eventually dipped to $75 per bottle. This would be my choice if Merrington’s breweries didn’t close down last year.

4. 4. BREWDOG’S SINK THE BISMARCK
Price: $80/375ml

Brewdog named this beer after Nazi Germany’s largest battleship, Sink the Bismarck since it was their attempt to sink the record of the strongest beer in the world which was held by Schorschbräu, a German brewery. They did it. The beer is even  41%ABV strong!

5. 5. SAMUEL ADAMS’ UTOPIAS

6. 6. SCHORSCHBRÄU’S SCHORSCHBOCK 57
Price: $275/330ml

With a score of 20/100 according to the guys at ratebeer.com, this 2011 Schorschbock 57 beer is claimed to be the strongest beer in the world and not just one of the most expensive beers. Master brewer Georg Tscheuschner says that a higher proof beer will violate the old Beer Purity Law of Germany’s 500-year-old guide. They were only 36 bottles made from this brand and each one has a price of €200. The proof book stands at 115 and has a smoky nutty taste.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2076647/85274952.jpg">

7. 7. CARLSBERG’S JACOBSEN VINTAGE
Price: $400/375ml

A danish brand, The Vintage Trilogy was created in 2008 with a purpose to challenge the luxury wine market. this wine is created by maturing it in Swedish and French oak barrels for six months and it is says that its taste is vanilla and cocoa. They made 600 bottles annually from 2008 to 2010. You can actually let this bottle stand until 2059 before the nutty taste goes bad, so you know you have time.

8. 8. BREWDOG’S THE END OF HISTORY
Price: $765/330ml

As the second most expensive beer in the world and a huge price tag of $765, this 110 proof beer thought it was going to end all beer wars. The guys at Brewdog didn’t realize other beers would beat them to the top. Only 12 bottles exists of this brand and this blonde Belgian ale was mixed with nettles and juniper from Scotland highlands. This brand sure is special and worth being on this list of the most expensive beers.

9. 9. PABST BLUE RIBBON 1844
Price: $44.00/720ml

Funny thing is that in the USA the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer is one of the cheapest brands you can get. But in China it is the highest quality you will find and costs $44 per bottle. How is that possible you ask? Well it is because it’s not the same beer. The Chinese PBR beer is actually an 1844 PBR and is made from German caramel malts and aged in uncharred American whisky barrels. It even comes in a cool glass bottle, Master Brewer Alan Kornhauser designed this brand to compete with expensive wine brand in China and it is not sold outside of the country.

10. 10. NAIL BREWING’S ANTARCTIC NAIL ALE
Price: $800-$1815/500ml

this is a special beer, because 100% of the profits go to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, that’s right, this beer is helping fighting whale hunters. How this beer is made will blow your mind, The Sea Shepherds took an helicopter and landed it on an Antarctic iceberg, than they dug a hole and took some ice, melted it in Tasmania and brew it in Perth. There’s only 30 bottles that ever got made and the first one was sold for $800.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">10 Odd Predictions That Came True</a>
1. Vladimir Odoevsky, who came out with a novel called “Year 4338” in 1835, described a world in which instant messaging, blogging, and even status updates were a very popular form of communication. Sounds a lot like social media, no?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85220368.jpg">

2. In 1987, Apple introduced the world to a video called “Knowledge Navigator.” It was about the future of computing and boy did they get it right. The video shows us touchscreen handheld devices, video calls, and a digital knowledge assistant, much like Siri does today. Interestingly enough, the date specified in the video is September 16th, 2011. That date is just 18 days away from when all of those features became available on the phone/tablet format.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85220369.jpg">

3. In 1953 an author by the name of Ray Bradbury released a novel called “Fahrenheit 451.” In this novel we are introduced to a world in which books are outlawed and burned. So, for people to learn, they are fed information through tiny seashells that are placed in their ears and fed radio signals. Nowadays with wireless headphones, that’s pretty much exactly what we have.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85220370.jpg">

4. In 1903 Edward Morgan Forrester released a novel called “The Machine Stops” which depicts a world in which people only communicate with each other using digital screens. He even goes as far as describing the fact that ideas and general knowledge are shared with everyone through a digital system that links everyone together. He pretty much predicted the internet before radio was even a mass medium.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85220371.jpg">

5. John Brunner’s 1968 novel “Stand On Zanzibar” made a bold prediction that in the year 2010, America would have an African American president named “Obomi.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85220372.jpg">

6. Gen. Billy Mitchell had plenty of highly successful flight programs against the Germans during WWI. After these successes, he went on record with an incredibly bold prediction about a future aerial attack. He stated: “Attack will be launched as follows: Bombardment, attack to be made on Ford Island (in Pearl Harbor) at 7:30 AM.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85220373.jpg">

7. Back in 1989, Frank Zappa’s “The Real Frank Zappa Book” describes in great detail a method in which people can buy and sell music digitally. He even goes as far as saying that this shift in music purchasing won’t happen for at least another decade. Well, look where we’re at now!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85220374.jpg">

8. A French Marshal by the name of Ferdinand Foch was either a cynic, a psychic, or a smart, smart man, because at the end of World War One, he stated “This is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.” Astonishingly enough, World War Two started 20 years and 28 days later.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85220375.jpg">

9. In 1993, a senior high school student by the name of Michael Lee had his yearbook quote say the following: “Chicago Cubs. 2016 World Champions. You heard it here first.” As we all know by now, the Cubs actually pulled it off this year. While there has been speculations that this year book quote was shopped, so far nobody has been able to prove it to be a fake. To this day there have been dozens of copies of the year book dug up by people who attended the same school, and all of them have the now infamous Cubs quote.

10. Cowboy Bepop, a popular anime in the late 90’s, aired a few episodes that featured a spacecraft that went by the name Columbia. The spacecraft was sent on a rescue mission that nearly failed thanks to its heat resistant tiles peeling off during the mission. The freaky part is that in 2003, the space shuttle Columbia went up in flames after its heat resistant tiles peeled off during take off.

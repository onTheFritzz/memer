1. Eleven-year-old Phil Mick was nervous to start his first day of sixth grade.

According to his mom, Tammy Mick of Auburn, Indiana, Phil had confessed that he didn't want to return to class after being bullied during his final year of elementary school.

2. "He was hiding it," Tammy Mick told ABC News. "He came home with bumps and bruises. He said he wanted to end his life and I stepped up as parent and tried to get things taken care of."

On Tuesday, Phil showed up for class with 50 bikers on motorcycles behind him, to escort Phil Mick to his first day of middle school on Aug. 1.

3. Phil Mick, 11, got a special ride on the back of the motorcycle of Brett Warfield, sales manager of KDZ Motorcycle Sales & Service, on his way to school.

Brent Warfield, sales manager of KDZ Motorcycle Sales & Service and a mutual friend of the Mick family, decided to step in and help after hearing about Phil's situation.

4. "When you hear an 11-year-old-kid talking about getting kicked and picked on all because they don't have as much money or wear nice clothes, being overweight and then having an 11-year-old son myself, it reached down deep and hit me," he said.

Warfield put a call out on Facebook for bikers to join him in escorting Phil to school on Aug. 1.

5. "It gave him confidence," he explained. "The middle school is a fresh start for him. I've talked to him several days since. He goes to school happy, comes home happy."

Mick said she'd like to encourage kids who are being bullied to share it with a loved one.

Answer: "It’s a tray table. It has another piece to it. It’s a tray with matching pegs. The tray goes on top and the pegs slide in. They fit together, so the tray sits tightly. Then you take the tray back to the kitchen and put the sliding part back, so it’s not in the way."

26. “A fork with tines of varying width — what is this used for?”

Answer: "It looks like a failure of quality control. When the punch came down to cut the slots, the fork blank wasn’t all the way in and was a bit cockeyed. If quality control wasn’t having an off day, it would have ended up in the bin."

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297464.jpg">

29. “These came in a cross-stitch kit. They’re flexible, made of rubber, and the 2 ends are magnetic, so they stick together.”

Answer: "They are magnetic cable clips that can be used to keep excess fabric out of the way when cross-stitching."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297465.jpg">

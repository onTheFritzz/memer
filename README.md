1. "I found an old upright piano that someone on craigslist was giving away for free. They had said that if no one wanted it, it was going to the dump. So I picked it up and hauled it back home. All the keys were stripped of it ivory so I couldn't salvaged any of it. I had this DIY project on my to do list for awhile. I finally I was able to start it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240449.jpg">

2. "I found a lumber mill that sold slabs of wood. (Please note, I do not have any carpentry skills whatsoever.) I wanted a solid piece for the desktop. I was able to get a 2 1/2in thick, 2ft wide and 6ft long board. I cut it down to fit inside where the piano keys had laid."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240450.jpg">

3. "I plained all the weather stain and uneven bowing of the wood. I used this hand liner for about 30mins and then I bought an electric plainer, because, aint nobody got time for dat."

6. "Next was to coat the desktop. I wanted to do epoxy seeing how it was the best stuff for taking a beating. It was either this or glass, and this was cheaper... and more fun."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240454.jpg">

7. "I had to put down a top coat first."

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240457.jpg">

10. "I used a blowtorch to pop the remaining bubbles."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240458.jpg">

11. "After it was done, I strongly debated weather or not I would strip the piano of its old stain and retain it, but instead I kept it because this was that piano's story. So I used feed-n-wax to polish and shine the wood."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240459.jpg">

12. "Seeing how this piano serviced the great depression, WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, and to this day, brings me such happiness, to know I have a little piece of history right in my own home."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240460.jpg">

13. "People will say that I ruined a fine piano, But I feel the opposite to that. I was able to take this piano, that was going to be thrown away, and give a new purpose in life."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240461.jpg">

14. "In the end, there were many flaws, but I am so happy with how it turned out." What do you think? Would you do something like this?

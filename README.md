## <a href="#link2" id="link1">30 Times Someone Tried To Warn The World</a>
1. In 2005, Courtney Love was asked what advice she'd give young, up and coming actresses. She said "If Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party at his Four Seasons hotel room, don't go." And for whatever reason, you didn't see her in many movies after that.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316772.jpg">

2. President George Washington, in his address when leaving office. He warned against the danger of a two party system in future politics. He felt that several parties on equal footing would be better. Especially in presidential elections. The more legitimate choices, the better.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316773.jpg">

3. Rowley warned her FBI superiors on June 01 that names on their jihadi watch list were taking flying lessons, but were not interested in learning how to land. Her report didn't get read until October.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316774.jpg">

4. Ignaz Semmelweis was often described as the father of hand washing. In the 1800s he discovered that infant maternal mortality could be drastically reduced by doctors washing their hands between patients. He was largely ignored and his book got absolutely slated. This is supposed to have contributed to him having a mental breakdown and he died in a psychiatric hospital.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316776.jpg">

5. Rick Rescorla, Director of Corporate Security for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, published a report in 1990 detailing the vulnerability of the World Trade Center parking garage. He and a colleague found they were able to freely walk into the garage, which contained many structural support columns, unchallenged by any security. Additionally no ID checks or screening was done on any of the entering delivery vehicles. Three years later a truck bomb was driven into the garage and detonated in an attempt to damage the building's structure. Later he and his same college would correctly predict the next attack on the building would come from the air. The evacuation plan and drills he put in place are credited with saving over 2,600 lives on September 11th.

6. French general Ferdinand Foch reportedly called the Treaty of Versailles a “twenty-year armistice.” WWII broke out approximately twenty years later.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316779.jpg">

7. Al Gore got an entire apology episode from the creators of South Park after they mocked him for trying to warn people about climate change.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316780.jpg">

8. Johnny Rotten attempted to warn people about Jimmy Saville.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316781.jpg">

9. Pearl Jam warned us about Ticketmaster years ago. Nobody listened, now we're stuck with them... and only them..
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316782.jpg">

10. Isaac Asimov in 1980: "There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that “my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316770.jpg">

11. Harry Marcopolos notified the SEC 3 times that whatever Bernie Madoff was doing wasn’t legit and should be investigated, and all 3 times he was ignored.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316785.jpg">

12. There was a book Nikola Tesla wrote called "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy" where he talked about slowing down the process of burning carbon until we understood it better.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316783.jpg">

13. Jason Salemi, epidemiologist at USF. I was working on medical ML research and was asked to help analyze some data about a new virus in China. In the middle of January we had a research meeting, and Dr. Salemi said, "I don't like this one, I have a bad feeling about SARS-NCOV," (as it was then called). On Feb 2020 I was put full time on the SARS-COV-2 team. The rest is history.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316784.jpg">

14. David Attenborough, and I don’t think we are listening. Well certainly not doing enough.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316775.jpg">

15. Gary Webb found ties linking the crack epidemic that wasted inner cities in the 90s, and "justified" the war on drugs, while also destabilizing the Nicaraguan government. He was basically raked over the coals for it, and wound up "committing suicide" with two bullets to the head.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316786.jpg">

16. 12 TRW engineers resigned their positions the morning of the Challenger incident in protest against risking the flight. NASA launched anyway. Should have listened.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316787.jpg">

17. An engineer involved with the Space Shuttle program warned his superiors for months prior to the Challenger disaster that launching in cold weather could cause the O-rings to fail. Care to guess what caused the Challenger disaster?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316777.jpg">

18. “I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time - when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority... The dumbing-down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites, lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.” -Carl Sagan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316771.jpg">

19. H. G. Wells said he wanted his epitaph to be "I told you so. You damned fools!" In "The Land Ironclads" he had written about a stalemated war fought by trench warfare that was broken by the invention of tanks, predicting what would happen in WW1. In "The War in the Air" he predicted how airplanes would be used in war, including aerial bombardment of cities, and saw his predictions come true in WW2.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316788.jpg">

20. Eddie Murphy took a shot at Bill Cosby's holier than thou attitude in his comedy special "Raw" in 1987 during the height of "The Cosby Show."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316789.jpg">

21. Seth Macfarlene has made fun of sleazy people in Hollywood for years before the Me Too movement. “Help I just escaped Kevin’s Spacey’s house,” says Stewie running naked through a crowd of people.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316790.jpg">

22. Cassandra of Troy was pretty spot on about that wooden horse.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316791.jpg">

23. John O'Neill worked in the FBI as an anti-terrorist officer. After the car-bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, he remained convinced that Al Qaeda would try to finish the job. The FBI convinced itself that it was over, and O'Neill, who kept at the investigation, was passed over for promotions to the point he wound up quitting the FBI. They thought he was too obsessed with it. He took a job managing security at the WTC and lost his life on September 11.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316792.jpg">

24. "In like ‘92, me and my Muslim roommate were watching something on tv about Osama Bin Laden. And he said, 'this guy is determined to accomplish an attack on American soil. And it’s going to happen in the next 10 years.' At the time, I thought he was crazy."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316793.jpg">

25. Turkish Airlines flight 981 would never have happened if McDonnell Douglas and Convair had heeded Dan Applegate's warning about the cargo doors coming open during flight. He wrote a memo after the nonfatal American Airlines flight 96 advising that the doors had design flaws which would cause them to show as properly latched even when they weren't. If nothing were done, he said it would lead to catastrophic failure that would likely result in the loss of the plane. However, the fixes would be expensive and no one agreed who would eat the cost, so proper upgrades were put off. Instead, they tried implementing cheaper band-aid solutions that would ultimately prove ineffective.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316794.jpg">

26. Bismarck warned the ruling German monarch of his time that Germany's status in Europe and the relative peace of the continent would last for only a short time. After his forced resignation, Bismarck said: "Jena came twenty years after the death of Frederick the Great; the crash will come twenty years after my departure if things go on like this". Twenty years later, Germany lost WWI and almost collapsed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316795.jpg">

27. Every single junior officer working in Afghanistan for the last 20 years who universally called the ANA a worthless POS army and their government a hallow, dead money pit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316796.jpg">

28. "In the UK we have a serial rapist and pedophile, TV and radio presenter called Jimmy Saville who was protected by his (admittedly) great charity work. In reality it was all just to divert attention away from his decades long abuse. Lots of people complained and they were all ridiculed, abused or ignored. Institutionally.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316797.jpg">

29. Mitt Romney warned that Russia was the enemy of peace. He was laughed at by both sides.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87316798.jpg">

30. Harry Markopolos. He figured out what Madoff was up to, and the SEC still blew him off for years, presumably because the proof he was presenting required math to understand.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">Dude Discovers A Hidden Dungeon Under His New Apartment</a>
1. So far I love the place, look at the high ceilings in the kitchen/living area.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398383.jpg">

2. In order to maximize the space in the cavernous building, they built a second level in his apartment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398384.jpg">

3. Yep, that’s his bedroom. Wouldn’t want to even try sleeping off a night of drinking on that thing. I get the bed spins pretty bad, and it looks like if he falls out of bed, he dies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398385.jpg">

4. The bathroom is decent; stand up shower, small sink… assume there’s a toilet.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398386.jpg">

5. Wait, there’s something on the floor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398387.jpg">

6. And that, urban explorers, in case you’re wondering, is the handle to a trapdoor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398388.jpg">

7. Against better judgement, he opens it up. He says this wasn’t mentioned anywhere on the lease, or even when the place was shown to him prior to the rental.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398389.jpg">

8. At first glance, it looks like some underfloor storage for some old tools and paint. Seems pretty unexciting. It’s not as if it could be hiding anything more creepy or nefarious, right? It’s a small, cheap studio apartment in an old monastery.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398390.jpg">

9. Except when you look at it from the bathroom, there’s a scary dark space that looks like it goes deeper.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398391.jpg">

10. Yep, those are stairs. Stairs that go down into a dark, stone-lined space below an old, medieval/Victorian building in England.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398392.jpg">

11. It’s a dungeon. An actual freaking dungeon below his place, that possibly spanned the footprint of the building. He wasn’t brave enough to do it alone, so he wedged his bathroom door over the closed hatch and called a friend.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398393.jpg">

12. Once the friend arrived, the headed downstairs. What they found was a proper 19th century layout of corridors, hatches and rooms underneath.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398394.jpg">

13. These are the scary stairs lead down into the dungeon. This is the only set of stairs that they found going down there, so thus far, he’s the only one that has access.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398395.jpg">

14. This space is underneath a neighbours apartment. It’s just an empty space full of bricks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398396.jpg">

15. More explorations.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398397.jpg">

16. Here it looks like the old, slatted subfloor is rotting away, and you can see the new subfloor above. So it’s not as if no one knew this space was here – the contractors must have been down there at some point.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398398.jpg">

17.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398399.jpg">

18. In one empty room, they found some graffiti. It looks relatively recent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398400.jpg">

19. It’s a pretty big space, with a lot of headroom. Demc7 says that it’s a little damp, but not horrible.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398401.jpg">

20. In the far corner is this. Looks like a crypt. You can imagine a coffin/sarcophagus there for some sort of Victorian Memento Mori/Spiritualist seance.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398402.jpg">

21. In the centre of the room he found a hole with recently disturbed soft dirt.It looks like something was buried down there. Something evil. Or not.

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">Husband Really Appreciates His Wife's Coworker Crush </a>
1. What a considerate gift!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123126/87286996/kevin8.png">

2. This is also a lovely gesture from Kevin. And in secret too! It's a shame he hasn't found that special someone yet though.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123131/87286997/kevin10.png">

3. This person understands. What a great friend.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123112/87286990/kevin1.jpg">

4. He even takes her on trips! What a great time that must have been.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123111/87286989/kevin2.jpg">

5. Dan's wife is also so lucky to have a husband that really cares about their financial future.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123121/87286993/kevin3.jpg">

6. Kevin really understands how to make Dan's wife happy. It's no wonder their marriage is stronger than ever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123113/87286991/kevin4.jpg">

7. Unfortunately, people are just so quick to assume things about Kevin and his relationship with Dan's wife. Miami and Nashville are such spiritual places.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123122/87286994/kevin7.png">

8. People are just so quick to judge things that they don't understand. Why is everyone always so negative?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123134/87286998/kevin9.png">

9. You see? How many people would just offer up their home like that? Kevin really is a next level friend.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/13/123118/87286992/kevin5.png">

10. And it seems like Kevin is a great friend to many people, not just this one couple.

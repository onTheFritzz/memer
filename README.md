## <a href="#link4" id="link3">25 Leonardo da Vinci Facts Hidden By History</a>
1. Leonardo Da Vinci saved 13,000+ pages of notes and drawings on anatomy, physiology, engineering, mechanics, geometry, mathematics, bird flight, flying machines, botany, proportions, topology, weaponry, musical instruments, art, and more, all in mirrored shorthand written from right to left.-u/wjbc
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255172.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255173.png">

3. Leonardo Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" as it exists today is largely a modern reconstruction.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255174.png">

9. Leonardo da Vinci never had a last name because he was born out of wedlock, thus leading to his “last name” being da Vinci (of Vinci) because the town he was born in was called Vinci.-deleted user
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255180.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255183.jpg">

13. Adoration Of The Magi is an unfinished work by Leonardo da Vinci commissioned by a Florentine monastery in 1480.

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">18 Celebs Who Destroyed Their Careers </a>
1. Chris Benoit. World famous and beloved wrestler who committed a double homicide, son and wife, suicide. -Willste
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265383.jpg">

2. Gia Carangi. She started modeling in 1978 at the age of 18. Reached her peak in 1979 and was considered THE supermodel. But by 1980 her career was already in steep decline due to her hardcore drug addiction alongside her erratic personality making her difficult to work with. by 1981 her career was basically over at only age 21.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265388.jpeg">

She tried to make multiple comebacks but it never stuck and officially left the modeling industry for good in 1983. She ended up working as a store clerk and even a prostitute for some time but in 1986 she ended up dying of AIDS at age 26 suspected to be caused by contaminated heroin needles.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265382.png">

She was in such poor condition when she died that when the doctors picked her up the skin fell off her back. no one in the fashion industry attended her funeral or even knew she had died. she fell just as quickly as she rose. In the end, no one she thought cared about her in new york ended up being there for her during her final months except for the friends she made in rehab. -AltruisticBreak9

3. The Hollywood of yesteryear had more than its fair share of career implosions such as Fatty Arbuckle and Harry Langdon but few can match Wallace Reid. Described as "the screen's most perfect lover", he was an all-round athlete and musician who wanted to move from theatre to film. He approached Vitagraph Studios with a story hoping he could direct it but the studio jumped on the opportunity to cast the 6-foot blue-eyed Reid as a matinee idol.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265385.jpg">

By 1922, he had appeared in nearly 200 pictures and even tried out for the Indy 500. Reid was hiding a secret, however. In 1919, he had been involved in a train wreck and was prescribed morphine for his injuries. As the pressure of stardom grew, he rapidly became addicted regularly spending 1,000 dollars on morphine but audiences noticed his rapid weight loss and gaunt features.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265381.png">

He collapsed on set in October 1922 and was sent to a sanatorium where he was locked in a padded cell as he tried to detox. He died of influenza on January 19th, 1923 and his death was a huge shock to the public, the first celebrity drug death.

4. Jared Fogle (the Subway guy). The things discovered about him are quite disturbing. Prison is an appropriate place for him. -u/Skirt_Thin
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265390.jpg">

5. Jan-Michael Vincent of Airwolf fame. His alcohol and drug abuse ruined a promising career and turned him into walking mummy towards the end. -u/RappScallion73
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265391.jpg">

6. Aaron Hernandez. Played tight end for the New England Patriots. Fresh off a new contract. Killed his friend, found guilty, then took his own life during the appeal. -u/c_c_c__combobreaker

8. Ian Watkins. Went from the frontman of a world-famous rock band, to doing 30 years for child sex offenses. -u/Mackem101

9. Mason Greenwood. Went from being effectively the top young prospect at Man United to never touching a professional football field again. F*ck him. -u/ClickableLink

10. OJ Simpson. -u/Foskey

11. Someone who was born into one of the most famous families in the world so would have anything he wanted. What he wanted was just that little bit too far. No sweating it. Come on down Prince Andrew. -u/ninja-wharrier
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265397.jpg">

12. Mark Salling. The guy who played Puck in Glee. Maybe not the BIGGEST star. But he was a fan favorite on a huge show. Got caught with Child Pornography, Pleaded Guilty, then hanged himself. That’s a pretty hard downward spiral. -u/SuperSaiyanBen
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265401.jpg">

13. Tila Tequila going from bisexual reality TV vixen to Nazi was pretty astonishing. -u/MsCellophane

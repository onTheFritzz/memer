<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174283.jpg">

8. Live suicide.
Fox News was covering a live car chase in in Phoenix when the driver, Jordan Romero, got out of his vehicle and committed suicide. The network immediately apologized for showing it live but it was already too late. Nobody could unsee what they just saw on the live broadcast

11. Manila hostage situation.
In 2010, people watched a live broadcast of former Manila police officer Rolando Mendoza taking hostages on a tour bus. In the end eight of the hostages were shot and killed as the cameras were on the bus. Since the event took place inside of the bus the cameras did not catch the murders.

13. A tense landing.
In 2005, we watched live as JetBlue Flight 292 was in trouble while landing. The difference in this event was that the passengers on the plane were actually able to watch the live television broadcast on their in seat televisions. All of the televisions were turned off just before the plane actually landed but they all knew they were in trouble.

Even though the landing gear was clearly not working properly, the pilot was able to land the plane safely as the country watched live.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174289.jpg">

15. The 2000 Presidential election.
The 2000 Presidential election was complete madness on election day. No network had a handle on the results coming in and CNN actually announced Al Gore as the winner before recanting the statement shortly afterward. Several networks reported different projected winners numerous times throughout the evening and nobody that was watching the live broadcasts had any idea who the real winner was until the following day.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174291.jpg">

16. Berlin Wall is no more.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174294.jpg">

19. Man on the moon.
600 million people watched live on July 20, 1969 as the United States put the first ever person on the moon. Neil Armstrong became famous when he told the world, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." When you hear shows that broadcast live talk about their high number of viewers remember that number. 600 million. That's simply amazing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174295.jpg">

20. World Series earthquake.
Game 3 of the 1989 World Series was postponed after a deadly earthquake hit the San Francisco bay area. The quake happened during the pre game show and was witnessed by millions live as it happened. Throughout the night the devastation was broadcast live around the world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174296.jpg">

21. Hurricane Katrina.
Today's weather forecasters can predict the landfall of a hurricane a week or so before it actually happens. This gives networks plenty of time to set up and capture the upcoming devastation. The Weather Channel broadcast the storm as it happened live and continued to do so several days after it hit. It brought the world the catastrophic events live.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174297.jpg">

22. O.J.'s slow car chase.
Before the world watched O.J. Simpson getting away with murder on live television, they watched live as he led police on a slow car chase when they were trying to take him into custody. The live coverage of the event consumed the nation as everything seemed to come to a halt so the world could watch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174298.jpg">

23. 9/11.
We all watched in horror as the second plane was purposely flown into the second World Trade Center building on live television. The cameras were trained on the first building, covering what no one really knew was happening at the time.

However, since 3 of those countries were conquered by the Nazi's, over a quarter of these Jews were shipped to camps and died.

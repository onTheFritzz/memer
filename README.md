1. His argument was founded on his claim that he could see a little areola.

8. Sheriff John T. Darr
September 26 at 8:11am ·

Good Morning,

I have seen and am aware of a post circulating Facebook, regarding a situation between a Muscogee County deputy and a woman attempting to breastfeed her young child. My wife and I have four children, each of whom were breastfed, and two of my daughters now have small children of their own. Therefore, I fully understand and appreciate the right of a woman to feed her child wherever she is most comfortable. It is also the law in the state of Georgia. We are currently looking into this incident and it will be addressed. Our office does not condone these actions and will ensure all officers know and understand the law. On behalf of the Muscogee County Sheriff's Office, I would like to personally extend an apology to the woman involved, and we hope that she knows that these are not the opinions or practices of the office as a whole.

Roxanne Lenae Phillips That's the problem now days the cops are not properly trained on the laws or how to handle situations. Women should be able to feed their babies anywhere without any shame. If it was your screaming baby hungry you would want him/her feed. But cops can make mistakes and its no big deal but we citizens make a mistake or drive 5 over the speed limit or silly things we have to pay for them.

Simon Boterkooper Dus het klopt wat je ziet in elke Amerikaanse tv series. Jullie zijn zo bang voor tepels dat vrouwen tijdens de sex hun bh aanhouden. En maar klagen over moslima's met een hoofddoek. Trieste mensen daar aan de andere kant van de plas.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Kim Kardashian Caught Doing Cocaine On Snapchat</a>
1. Kim Kardashian came under fire earlier today after posting this snapchat, where on the table behind her, appears to be two lines of cocaine. She quickly took to Twitter to dismiss the claims.

3. Kim and her daughter were seen in Dylan's Candy store in NYC on Sunday and somehow that candy survived long enough to leave its mark this morning on Kim's snapchat.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85405844.jpg">

4. So what do you think? Was Kim racking lines of blow in her kitchen this morning or was the mysterious powder in fact sugar? We may never know the truth because when dealing with the Kardashians it's hard to tell the difference between what's real and what's fake.

1. Chris Benoit. World famous and beloved wrestler who committed a double homicide, son and wife, suicide. -Willste

2. Gia Carangi. She started modeling in 1978 at the age of 18. Reached her peak in 1979 and was considered THE supermodel. But by 1980 her career was already in steep decline due to her hardcore drug addiction alongside her erratic personality making her difficult to work with. by 1981 her career was basically over at only age 21.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265388.jpeg">

She tried to make multiple comebacks but it never stuck and officially left the modeling industry for good in 1983. She ended up working as a store clerk and even a prostitute for some time but in 1986 she ended up dying of AIDS at age 26 suspected to be caused by contaminated heroin needles.

She was in such poor condition when she died that when the doctors picked her up the skin fell off her back. no one in the fashion industry attended her funeral or even knew she had died. she fell just as quickly as she rose. In the end, no one she thought cared about her in new york ended up being there for her during her final months except for the friends she made in rehab. -AltruisticBreak9

3. The Hollywood of yesteryear had more than its fair share of career implosions such as Fatty Arbuckle and Harry Langdon but few can match Wallace Reid. Described as "the screen's most perfect lover", he was an all-round athlete and musician who wanted to move from theatre to film. He approached Vitagraph Studios with a story hoping he could direct it but the studio jumped on the opportunity to cast the 6-foot blue-eyed Reid as a matinee idol.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265385.jpg">

By 1922, he had appeared in nearly 200 pictures and even tried out for the Indy 500. Reid was hiding a secret, however. In 1919, he had been involved in a train wreck and was prescribed morphine for his injuries. As the pressure of stardom grew, he rapidly became addicted regularly spending 1,000 dollars on morphine but audiences noticed his rapid weight loss and gaunt features.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265381.png">

He collapsed on set in October 1922 and was sent to a sanatorium where he was locked in a padded cell as he tried to detox. He died of influenza on January 19th, 1923 and his death was a huge shock to the public, the first celebrity drug death.

12. Mark Salling. The guy who played Puck in Glee. Maybe not the BIGGEST star. But he was a fan favorite on a huge show. Got caught with Child Pornography, Pleaded Guilty, then hanged himself. That’s a pretty hard downward spiral. -u/SuperSaiyanBen

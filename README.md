## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Meet The World’s Tallest Teenager Who Can't Stop Growing</a>
1. Broc Brown of Michigan is 19 years old and is 7'8" tall...and growing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147942.jpg">

2. He’s been sprouting upward at a rate of about six inches per year, and if that pace continues, which is a very real possibility, he’ll become the world’s tallest man.Take a look at just how big Broc’s been since he was born.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147955.jpg">

3. He was 5'2" in kindergarten. They didn't know where the height came from, as both his parents are normal height, but they all later learned that it is a genetic issue and is glandular
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147957.jpg">

4. If you can believe it, he was standing 6 feet tall BEFORE he hit his growth spurt...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147943.jpg">

5.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147944.jpg">

6. By the start of high school, he was standing almost 7 feet tall.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147945.jpg">

7. Says his mom, “It’s a genetic disorder and there’s nothing that can stop him from growing – I don’t know if he will ever stop.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147946.jpg">

8. Of course, if he doesn't stop, he's not just in for an uncomfortable life...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147947.jpg">

9. ...but serious health issues that can take the form of circulation issues, bone and structural problems, and other effects from an imbalance of hormones.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147948.jpg">

10. But he remains a happy kid who's enjoying the notoriety he's getting for his huge physique.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147949.jpg">

11. But as tall people know, the world isn't built for towering giants, and Broc has an especially tough go of it, given his height.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147950.jpg">

12. Sure, towering at over 7'8" has its benefits on the basketball court...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147951.jpg">

13. ...and it makes for a very fun icebreaker with strangers...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147952.jpg">

14. But the logistical issues are present in everything from his bed...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147953.jpg">

15. ...to his living room...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147954.jpg">

16. ...to the family car.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85147956.jpg">

17. Hopefully, Broc stops growing soon, because, as interesting as it would be to inherit the title of the world’s tallest person, the health issues in growing any taller than he is currently are grave.But knowing that he can’t do anything about it, Broc’s cheery disposition is allowing him to take everything in (a very large) stride.

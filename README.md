<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170538.png">

3. The Hungarian serial killer Béla Kiss is thought to have murdered at least 23 young women and 1 man, and attempted to pickle them in giant metal drums. When WWI began, he was conscripted and left his house. When his crimes were discovered, he evaded capture and was never heard from again

5. A $350m drillship built in the early ’70s by US billionaire, Howard Hughes, to collect ‘mineral riches’ from the ocean floor was actually a cover for the CIA to be used to lift a lost Soviet submarine, loaded with nuclear missiles, up from the floor of the Pacific Ocean, 3 miles deep.

The US buried the Soviet bodies from the disaster with full military honors and we showed the utmost respect. We also recorded it because we wanted the Russians to know we were respectful of their dead even though we were pillaging a shipwreck for military technology.

Tyler who was 27 at the time, dated and did drugs with Holcolm for 3 years before they eventually broke up after an unplanned pregnancy which resulted in an abortion.

Lori Maddox was a part of the Los Angeles groupie scene beginning in the early 1970s. According to Maddox, Page became infatuated with her and had a roadie bring Maddox up to his suite at the L.A. Hyatt House. “(He was) wearing this hat over his eyes and holding a cane,” she remembered. “He looked just like a gangster. It was magnificent.” Maddox was, amazingly, just 14 when she met Page, though Page did what he could to keep the relationship hidden. The pair went on to have a torrid affair over the next few years.

11. During the 1988 purges in Iran, women were lashed for missing their daily prayers. When one woman died after 22 days and 550 lashes, the authorities certified her death as suicide because it was ‘she who had made the decision not to pray’.

12. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory didn’t have Charlie in the name because at the time of release, the Vietnam War was at its height and American soldiers referred to both Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces as “Charlie”

13. Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception, among other films does not use a cell phone or an e-mail because he’s just “not interested”, it gives him “time to think”, and he also prohibits them on the set of a movie.

Well, I’ve never used email because I don’t find it would help me with anything I’m doing. I just couldn’t be bothered about it. As far as the cellphone goes, it’s like that whole thing about “in New York City, you’re never more than two feet from a rat” — I’m never two feet from a cellphone. I mean, we’ll be on a scout with 10 people and all of them have phones, so it’s very easy to get in touch with me when people need to. When I started in this business, not many people had cellphones, I didn’t have one, I never bothered to get one and I’ve been very fortunate to be working continuously, so there’s always someone around me who can tap me on the shoulder and hand me a phone if they need to. I actually really like not having one because it gives me time to think. You know, when you have a smartphone and you have 10 minutes to spare, you go on it and you start looking at stuff.

14. The Bohemian Grove is a 137 year old secret camp, that Nixon called “the most faggy goddamn thing you could ever imagine”. The camp is private and only open to the rich and powerful men of the world.

Every republican U.S. president since 1923 has been a member of club, including Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, and the Bush family maintains a strong involvement to this day. The top secret operation behind the development of the atomic bomb, known as the Manhattan Project, was first planned at the Grove in 1942, and it’s said to have played a key role in major political and business deals since it was founded in the late 1800s. This place is a conspiracy theorist’s dream come true. But it’s also a summer camp in the middle of a remote forest where the global elite can take off their ties and behave like a bunch of lost boys who’ve tied up their camp counsellor; free to run wild and break all the rules…

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">20 Celebrities Who Destroyed Their Own Careers</a>
1. Antonio Brown. Drove 100 down McKnight Road in Pittsburgh, which has a 45 MPH speed limit. Tried to fight Mike Mayock, called him a cracker, had to be held back by Vontaze Burfict, then punted a football down the practice field and said "fine me for that." The sexual assault allegations came out. Etc, etc... -reverend_fancypants
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020139/87289829/ab.jpg">

2. Bam Margera for me. He looks horrible now, like his dad but worse. Wouldn't be surprised if I wake up one morning and he's dead. -True_Egg_5685
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020142/87289830/bam.jpg">

3. John Belushi. In a brief period in the 1970s starred in 'SNL', 'Animal House',  and 'The Blues Brothers'. but died in 1982 from a heroin overdose. -c-fox
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020149/87289831/belushi.png">

4. Brad Renfro. He died of a drug overdose at the age of 25 after a steep downward spiral. It is suspected he was the victim of Hollywood predator types when he was still a young boy, right after starring in "The Client" as his star was rapidly ascending. -igneousink
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020150/87289832/bradrenfro.jpg">

5. I know it’s a bit of a niche but… Conor McGregor. The Khabib fight was the biggest in his career. Two years of layoff, returning to face an unstoppable juggernaut. The press conferences were packed with vitriol and pure bile rather than the typical tongue in cheek charm. It was uncharacteristic - or rather, it was the mask coming off at last.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020153/87289834/conor.jpg">

He got humiliated badly, and everything went wild. Cocaine. Sexual assault scandals, whether true or not. Alcohol. He started his own whiskey brand. Apparently it’s garbage, but don’t take it from me. Take it from the old man he sucker punched in a bar for refusing to drink it. -DrJonesPHD62
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020157/87289835/cosby.jpg">

6. Bill Cosby. He was America's favorite Dad, stand up comic, had several very successful TV shows, spoke at colleges....then poof! He's just a dirty creepy guy who spikes your drink so he can get some. -Eponarose
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020135/87289828/amandabynes.jpg">

7. Amanda Bynes. Went from the girl next door cast in every teen movie to a conservatorship and addiction issues. -Kmammy
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020158/87289836/jim.jpg">

8. Jim Morrison. The guy would show up drunk and absolutely wrecked all the time during recordings, got arrested on many occasions for his behavior, and later on dies literally right after coming from a bar in his own bathtub. It’s sad and I absolutely adore him as an artist but man is it sad to hear what he got himself into leading to his inevitable death. -TheBeanBagger
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020159/87289837/johnny.jpg">

9. Johnny Manziel. He beeat Alabama, won the Heisman trophy, was on top of the college football world. Still got drafted in the first round despite trouble starting to mount in his final year at Texas A&M.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020202/87289838/amywinehouse.jpg">

Struggled immensely on and off the field in Cleveland (domestic violence, disappearing to Vegas wearing a disguise, and much more), was out of the NFL after two seasons, and was dropped by nearly everyone in his circle. Popped back up in the CFL, then to the Alliance League, and now he’s a former Heisman Trophy winner/1st round NFL Draft pick playing in the Fan-Controlled Football League. -MIDNIGHT_KNIGHT
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020209/87289839/jussie.jpg">

10. Amy Winehouse. Watching her destruction throughout 2007 and 2008 was just horrible, it was like a car crash that no one could stop. I’ve never been able to watch the footage of her final concert in Belgrade as she just looks terrified and with no control. -Btd030914
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020211/87289840/lance.jpg">

11. Jussie Smollett. I think his prime motivation was that fame wasn’t enough for him. He wanted to become a symbol, too. And what’s a more positive symbol than standing against racism?  -PenguinGunner
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020216/87289841/michaelrichards.jpg">

12. Lance Armstrong had an incredible fall from grace. From multiple Tour de France champion to steroid denier, and finally admitted everything but too late. Lost everything and he couldn't even get sympathy when he went through testicular cancer, that's how bad his spiral was. -jspockman
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020217/87289842/kurt.jpg">

13. Michael Richards comes to mind. Massive role as Kramer in one of the most popular TV sitcoms of all time, and then, yikes. Just no coming back from his stand-up meltdown. -Trillamanjaroh
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020221/87289843/mel.jpg">

14. Kurt Cobain. Formed Nirvana in '87, and went from playing record store gigs and dive bars in the late 80's to putting out Nevermind, a record that knocked Michael Jackson out of the #1 spot in Jan of '92. Back then, something like that was unheard of and considered impossible in the industry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020151/87289833/chris.jpg">

For the next couple of years Nirvana were arguably one of the biggest and most popular rock bands in the world, but Cobain was already thinking of ways to essentially sabotage the bands popularity because he was so uncomfortable with how famous they got while dealing with his own inner demons and drug addiction. -DrRDuke
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020225/87289844/shia.jpg">

15. Maybe not most destructive, but Mel Gibson fell hard.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020226/87289845/whitney.jpg">

Guy went from being quite a beloved and pretty decent actor to a respected director, and then said some really hateful things about Jews in the back of a police car (among other things). -Jonnydodger
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020230/87289846/wilkesbooth.jpg">

16. I think of Chris Farley. His SNL career started in '92(ish), his real break came with 'Tommy Boy' in '94. Dead by '98 at 33 years old. Horribly addicted to drugs, alcohol, food, and other impulse related stuff probably. Probably gained 100lbs in his 6 year run.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">13 Fascinating Facts To Feed Your Brain </a>
1. A Russian MIG Pilot defected during the cold war along with his aircraft. When he arrived in the USA he was convinced the CIA had specially stocked the grocery stores he went to because he couldn’t believe the vast array of products for sale.

Q: Like what did you do, for example?
Belenko: First of all American super-market, my first visit was under CIA supervision, and I thought it was set-up; I did not believe super-market was real one. I thought well I was unusual guest; they probably kicked everyone out. It’s such a nice, big place with incredible amount of produce, and no long lines! You’re accustomed to long lines in Russia. But later, when I discovered super-market was real one, I had real fun exploring new products. I would buy, everyday, a new thing and try to figure out its function. In Russia at that time (and even today) it’s hard to find canned food, good one. But everyday I would buy new cans with different food. Once I bought a can which said “dinner.” I cooked it with potatoes, onions, and garlic-it was delicious. Next morning my friends ask me, “Viktor, did you buy a cat?” It was a can of chicken-based cat food. But it was delicious! It was better than canned food for people in Russia today. And I did test it. Last year I brought four people from Russia for commercial project, and I set them up. I bought nibble sized human food. I installed a pâté, and it was cat food. I put it on crackers. And they did consume it, and they liked it. So the taste has not changed. By the way, for those who are not familiar with American cat food. It’s very safe; it’s delicious, and sometimes it’s better than human food, because of the Humane Society.

2. The Nazis developed an experimental drug cocktail called D-IX in which the Nazi doctors found that equipment-laden test subjects who had taken the drug could march 55 miles without resting.

Pharmacologist Gerhard Orzechowski and a group of other researchers were commissioned in Kiel to develop this drug, and by later in the year developed a formula which contained in each tablet: 5 mg of oxycodone (brand name Eukodal), 5 mg of cocaine and 3 mg of methamphetamine (then called Pervitin, now available under the brand name Desoxyn).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310219.jpg">

3. The Canadian government established one of the most northern settlements in the world by tricking 8 families into living there and then not allowing them to leave.

“The settlement (and Resolute) was created by the Canadian government in 1953, partly to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War. Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife. They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada’s claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were forced to stay.”

4. Even though he was a teenager during the Great Depression, John F. Kennedy confessed he really didn’t know about it until he read about it at Harvard. 

Joe Kennedy never publicly revealed his wealth, but the New York Times estimated his net worth at $500,000,000 when he died in 1969
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310221.jpg">

5. A Man Stopped Growing At Six Months Old Is Now 21 And Only 23 Inches Tall
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310222.png">

6. During the Vietnam War Hugh Thompson Jr. order his men to turn their guns on American soldiers to protect Vietnamese civilians and helped put a stop to the My Lai Massacre (mass killing of between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians in South Vietnam)

Realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese, Thompson landed his aircraft between them and the villagers. Thompson turned to Colburn and Andreotta and told them that if the Americans began shooting at the villagers or him, they should fire their M60 machine guns at the Americans: “Y’all cover me! If these bastards open up on me or these people, you open up on them. Promise me!”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310223.jpg">

7. During WW2 Joe Medicine Crow, a native American, completed all four feats required to be a war chief: touching an enemy without killing him, taking an enemy’s weapon, leading a war party and stealing 50 horses from the SS, singing a Crow honour song as he rode away

He touched a living enemy soldier and disarmed him after turning a corner and finding himself face to face with a young German soldier:
The collision knocked the German’s weapon to the ground. Mr. Crow lowered his own weapon and the two fought hand-to-hand. In the end Mr. Crow got the best of the German, grabbing him by the neck and choking him. He was going to kill the German soldier on the spot when the man screamed out ‘momma.’ Mr. Crow then let him go.

8. A man once tried to sue Pepsi because he found a mouse in his can of Mountain Dew, Pepsi defended the case by proving that Mountain Dew can dissolve a mouse in a few months
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310225.png">

9. Stephen King’s formula on writing is “Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can’t expect to become a good writer.” He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310226.jpg">

10. Pepsi is being sued because of its Naked Juice marketing. While the juice is marketed as “healthy”, it actually has a higher sugar content than an equivalent amount of Pepsi Cola.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310227.jpg">

11. Coke was sued for the “unwarranted health claims” on their product Vitaminwater. Coke’s defense was “no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking vitamin water was a healthy beverage.”

12. Serial killer Javed Iqbal was sentenced to death by being strangled in front of his victims family’s, dismembered and then burned in a vat of acid, in the same way he killed over 100 16 year old boys. He was found dead in his cell before the execution could be carried out.

He was only caught because he sent a confession letter to the police in which he gave his address and left the remains of 2 victims in his house.
A placard in his home read: “All details of the murders are contained in the diary and the 32-page notebook that have been placed in the room and had also been sent to the authorities. This is my confessional statement.” Another placard read: “The bodies in the house have deliberately not been disposed of so that the authorities will find them after my suicide.”

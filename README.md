6. Her dad walking in after I'd literally just finished. She still had (just) a skirt on but there’s me standing proud and looking very pleased with myself. He stammered "sorry" and closed the door. Needless to say dinners afterwards were interesting. -alpubgtrs234

9. One girl's meth-dealing brother broke into her apartment while we were doing the deed, and then told me that I was on his turf so I had to enjoy his company until he wanted to leave. I had not met him previously.

Edit - No, he did not want to watch his sister bang, he was asking for food or money or something, I forget. -Jefffahfffah

11. Ex decided to be fancy and she took a mouthful of champagne before giving me a blowjob. Bubbles from the champagne went up my d*ck hole. Incredibly painful, don't recommend. -Ninja_badgers

12. Thought it would be hot to get slapped in the face, so I asked to be slapped in the face. I was promptly slapped in the face.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121224/87289119/jalp.jpg">

I found out very quickly I do not enjoy being slapped in the face. -Impastaz72

14. Probably a guy that wrapped his legs around my head while I went down on him. He squeezed so tight to the point where I couldn’t breathe. My lizard brain started to panic so I bit down to make him stop so I could breathe. -daedrictofu

16. My roommate was in a dry spell but was really interested in a woman we would see at the bar. She was always with her roommate, who was very protective and wouldn't let her friend stay out past 12 AM.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121239/87289124/police.jpg">

The guardian roommate also could have been a goblin. So, I decided to flirt with her to keep them out later and let my roomie have a chance. It worked, and they went home together. But then the Great Goblin decided I should come home with her. Thinking that a "no" would mean she gets home angry and kills whatever my roomie had going, I decide to go along.

I mean, I never said "no", but I didn't enjoy any part of that experience. She poured wax on me (and herself), tried to convince me to go bareback, and then said I wasn't big enough to get her off and had me use a baseball bat-size tentacle toy on her. -Minute_Cartoonist509

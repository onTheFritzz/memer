17. The Mona Lisa stolen from the Louvre, 1911.

Two years went by before the true culprit was discovered, an Italian petty criminal called Vincenzo Perugia who had moved to Paris in 1908 and worked at the Louvre for a time. He went to the gallery in the white smock that all the employees there wore and hid until it closed for the night when he removed the Mona Lisa from its frame. When the gallery reopened he walked unobtrusively out with the painting under his smock, attracting no attention, and took it to his lodgings in Paris.
It was not until November 1913, calling himself Leonardo Vincenzo, that Perugia wrote to an art dealer in Florence named Alfredo Geri offering to bring the painting to Italy for a reward of 500,000 lire. He travelled to Florence by train the following month, taking the Mona Lisa in a trunk, hidden beneath a false bottom. After booking into a hotel, which subsequently shrewdly changed its name to the Hotel La Gioconda, he took the painting to Geri’s gallery. Geri persuaded him to leave it for expert examination and the police arrested Perugia later that day.
Perugia apparently believed, entirely mistakenly, that the Mona Lisa  had been stolen from Florence by Napoleon and that he deserved a reward for doing his patriotic duty and returning it to its true home in Italy. That was what he said, at least. Many Italians welcomed the masterpiece home; people flocked to see it for a time at the Uffizi Gallery, some of them weeping with joy, and Perugia served only a brief prison sentence. The great painting was duly returned to the Louvre and has hung there safely and enigmatically ever since.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">Couple Moves Into An Older Home And Find A Fallout Shelter</a>
1. When  Colleen and Chris Otcasek bought a new home in Woodland Hills, they had no idea that their new home held a pretty awesome secret. I mean, it had the usual features that you look for in a home; great kitchen large bedrooms, a huge backyard…With the except of their very own FALLOUT SHELTER!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258282.jpg">

2. The real estate agent told them that the lot had a pretty ‘unusual feature’ in the back yard; a large, concrete-lined hole. They were told that the hole used to lead to a fallout shelter from the Cold War Era, but in all honesty, no one had gone down there all this time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258283.jpg">

3. One day, they were feeling brave, so they invited someone from the local radio station and went down the rusted ladder and found an old door at the bottom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258284.jpg">

4. Inside they found a small fallout shelter, large enough for a family of four, full of everything you’d need to survive a nuclear attack. The bunker contained water, canned food, clothing, and medicine, as well as magazines and books. Everything was still pristine and vintage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258285.jpg">

5. So wondering who’d be the type of person to build a fallout shelter in the middle of a valley outside of Los Angeles, so they did a little research and contacted the media. While building a fallout shelter during the cold war was a common practice, to find one like this one, it must have had a pretty interesting story.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258286.jpg">

6. Soon they got a hit from Debrah Kaufman, who visited the couple at the house and told the couple that her father Alvin, was the one to build the shelter, back in 1961. He figured, if he built it 15 feet below ground, it would be safe enough for his family.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258287.jpg">

7. Alvin Kaufman was a self-taught nuclear engineer working as a contractor for a few companies, testing the effects of nuclear war on industry and of course, what it would do to humans. Knowing firsthand what the effects were, he wanted to do something to keep his family safe.The irony, though, is that he approached everyone in his cul-de-sac and offered to build one big enough for everyone. They said no. So he just made one for himself and his family, filled with several sleeping areas, a water tank, a hand cranked air filter and enough food to last several weeks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258288.png">

8. The shelves were full of  food from the era, all still sealed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258289.jpg">

9. This is probably the most important thing for a fallout shelter, coffee. Although this can has seen better days.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258290.jpg">

10. Multi-Purpose food, was a powdered protein mix that was created by a California inventor, by the name of Clifford E. Clinton and his biochemist friend Dr. Henry Borsook in 1946. The MPF was meant to provide proper nutrition at a very affordable price.

11. A few board games to help pass the time.

13. No shelter is complete with out plenty of tissue and toilet paper!

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Nostradamus' Horrific And Incredible 2017 Predictions </a>
1. Nostradamus, the 16th-century physician, and seer has become gospel to most people wondering what will happen in the upcoming year.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2421030/85229649.jpeg">

2. Nostradamus has predicted such tragedies as The Great London Fire, the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany and the attacks on September the 11th. So it's only natural that people would turn to him to see what would happen in 2017, and it's not that great . . .
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2421030/85229647.png">

3. What Nostradamus has predicted for 2017 is the rise of a leader he refers to as "The great shameless, audacious bawler." And that the "An agreement broken: lifting the face to heaven: the bloody mouth will swim with blood . . ." Which doesn't sound too promising for the upcoming year?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2421030/85229648.jpg">

4. On top of Nostradamus' predictions, the predictions of his counter seer Baba Vanga of the Balkans isn't too promising either. He predicted that the 44th president of The United States would be African-American and be the countries last. Which doesn't bode well for the U.S. if they want to keep their country going, while the ground is shaky with Russia and a trade war is on the verge with China, which could totally cripple the U.S. economy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2421030/85229646.jpg">

5. To top it off there is a thing in Italy known as a "blood miracle" where the solid blood of 4th century Saint Januarius is supposed to liquefy during the ceremony. Only a few times has it not liquefied and every time something horrible has happened including an earth shattering earthquake, a huge cholera outbreak that killed thousands and the rise of Nazi power in Italy. Happy 2017 everyone!

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">One Man's Epic Struggle Against A Chicago Deep Dish Pizza</a>
1. "My wife  is interviewing people to join her practice today during an ophthalmological conference in Chicago. I came up from Atlanta with her to enjoy Chi-Town.  . I decided to get some famous Giordano's pizza for lunch.  In order to get the stuffed deep dish, you wait 45 minutes for the thing to cook. I opted for the Chicago Classic..."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2016/10/17/120326/85167206/11.jpg">

2. He soon realized the struggle that lay before him...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85166587.png">

3. He later added "I have just removed to final slice of he pie and placed it on my plate. The waitress looks concerned and a bit disgusted. She offered me a box and I vehemently expressed that it would not be necessary. My face is tingling. I have just googled what this could be a symptom of. Typing is difficult as my hands are starting to tingle too."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85166588.jpg">

4. The last entry was "The waitress looks concerned. The table of four people next to me just ordered a box for the remaining slices of the same size pizza I just ate alone. This is the single greatest accomplishment of my life. Alone. In a relatively vacant restaurant an hour bike ride south of Chicago city center, I have overcome all odds. If only one person reads this and is inspired by it, my sacrifice is worth it. I love you all. If my heart stops beating on my bike ride back into Chicago, my last breath will whisper, "Delicious," across space and time to reach pizza lovers across the globe.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">18 Celebs Who Were Unfairly Cancelled</a>
1. Fatty Arbuckle. He was a comedian from like the 1930s or 40s that he got accused of r*ping an actress. In truth, she had like an overdose and had a bunch of health problems due to backalley abortions; even though he was proven innocent, his career never recovered from this. -MisterVictor13

2. The Chicks (formally known as the Dixie Chicks). They never returned to where they were before they called out Bush, and they’re wonderful. -hollyofhyrule
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032550/87317533/chicks.jpg">

3. Al Franken. He got cancelled for posing in a picture like he was honking someone's boobs, no actual touching. And some chick at the State Fair who asked to take a picture with him was freaked out that he put his hand on her waist. -CashPrizesz

4. Eartha Kitt told a president's wife about the unfair reality of POC being pushed to the front lines like fodder and that lead to her basically bring exiled like seriously exiled from the U.S for a very long time. -Trai-Harder

5. I’m surprised nobody has said this, but Richard Gere. The man was really popular as an actor until he mentioned the poor treatment of Tibet by the Chinese government. -Lol25Talks

6. Courtney Love was blacklisted and “cancelled” in Hollywood for publicly warning other female celebrities about Harvey Weinstein in the early 2000s. -Cheri-baby
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032555/87317534/courtneylove.jpg">

7. Aziz Ansari. Here’s my understanding: He went on a date, when then girl went back to his place he asked for a BJ. She said no. He said OK and they watched TV. Then he asked again. She said yes. And that's it.

But he should have been more accepting of her reluctance and she should have stood up for herself sooner. -FYoCouchEddie

12. Jenna Marbles. In all fairness I think she cancelled herself. People went digging and got offended at what they found. She apologized for the fake tan thing, stopped doing YT, and just went on living her best life. -hellokiri

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">18 Celebs Who Destroyed Their Careers </a>
1. Chris Benoit. World famous and beloved wrestler who committed a double homicide, son and wife, suicide. -Willste
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265383.jpg">

2. Gia Carangi. She started modeling in 1978 at the age of 18. Reached her peak in 1979 and was considered THE supermodel. But by 1980 her career was already in steep decline due to her hardcore drug addiction alongside her erratic personality making her difficult to work with. by 1981 her career was basically over at only age 21.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265388.jpeg">

She tried to make multiple comebacks but it never stuck and officially left the modeling industry for good in 1983. She ended up working as a store clerk and even a prostitute for some time but in 1986 she ended up dying of AIDS at age 26 suspected to be caused by contaminated heroin needles.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265382.png">

She was in such poor condition when she died that when the doctors picked her up the skin fell off her back. no one in the fashion industry attended her funeral or even knew she had died. she fell just as quickly as she rose. In the end, no one she thought cared about her in new york ended up being there for her during her final months except for the friends she made in rehab. -AltruisticBreak9
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265384.png">

3. The Hollywood of yesteryear had more than its fair share of career implosions such as Fatty Arbuckle and Harry Langdon but few can match Wallace Reid. Described as "the screen's most perfect lover", he was an all-round athlete and musician who wanted to move from theatre to film. He approached Vitagraph Studios with a story hoping he could direct it but the studio jumped on the opportunity to cast the 6-foot blue-eyed Reid as a matinee idol.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265385.jpg">

By 1922, he had appeared in nearly 200 pictures and even tried out for the Indy 500. Reid was hiding a secret, however. In 1919, he had been involved in a train wreck and was prescribed morphine for his injuries. As the pressure of stardom grew, he rapidly became addicted regularly spending 1,000 dollars on morphine but audiences noticed his rapid weight loss and gaunt features.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265381.png">

He collapsed on set in October 1922 and was sent to a sanatorium where he was locked in a padded cell as he tried to detox. He died of influenza on January 19th, 1923 and his death was a huge shock to the public, the first celebrity drug death.

4. Jared Fogle (the Subway guy). The things discovered about him are quite disturbing. Prison is an appropriate place for him. -u/Skirt_Thin

5. Jan-Michael Vincent of Airwolf fame. His alcohol and drug abuse ruined a promising career and turned him into walking mummy towards the end. -u/RappScallion73

10. OJ Simpson. -u/Foskey

11. Someone who was born into one of the most famous families in the world so would have anything he wanted. What he wanted was just that little bit too far. No sweating it. Come on down Prince Andrew. -u/ninja-wharrier
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265397.jpg">

12. Mark Salling. The guy who played Puck in Glee. Maybe not the BIGGEST star. But he was a fan favorite on a huge show. Got caught with Child Pornography, Pleaded Guilty, then hanged himself. That’s a pretty hard downward spiral. -u/SuperSaiyanBen
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265401.jpg">

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Everyday Design Features You Never Knew The Purpose Of</a>
1. Bottom of Wine Bottles.
What's the purpose of the indentation at the bottom of your daily drink of choice? It's to relieve pressure while removing the cork. You'll notice that champagne bottles have an even larger one.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167408.jpg">

2. The Tiny Hole in iPhones.
You'll notice a tiny hole between the lens and flash on your iPhone. It's a microphone! But aren't there already two others? The primary mic, the one you're used to seeing, is used for picking up a variety of noises, including your voice, while the secondary mic picks up ambient noise. There's a noise-canceling circuit that eliminates background noises and makes your voice sound clearer.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167409.jpg">

3. MacBook Charger Hooks.
You've probably learned about this one when it went viral a few years ago but the hooks on your MacBook charger are there to help prevent you from breaking it. The next time you're putting it away, try wrapping it like this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167410.jpg">

4. Bobby Pin Grooves.
Most women are surprised to learn that the grooves actually face the bottom. When you think about it, it makes perfect sense. When they're planted on the bottom, they stay more secure.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167411.jpg">

5. The Hole on the Handles of Pots And Pans.
Chefs sometimes use the hole to hang their pots and pans (great space saving tip) but you can also use it to leave your spoon as your dish simmers, assuming that it will fit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167412.jpg">

6. The Arrow on Your Gas Gauge.
How many times have you stopped at the gas station and forgotten which side you need to pump your gas? Well, this time you don't need to get out of your car to check. Look for the arrow to find out which side the fuel hatch is on.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167413.jpg">

7. Miniature Pocket and Rivets on Jeans.
The smallest pocket in your jeans could barely fit your finger and that's because it was originally meant for a pocket watch. As for the rivets, they look like pointless buttons but they're actually there to reinforce the seams of the pockets. Pockets are vulnerable to rips so this greatly improves the item's endurance.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167414.jpg">

8. The Life-Saving Hole.
According to an article published on The Independent, about 100 people die every year from choking on pen caps. You'll notice that BIC pens have hole at the tip of their lids. This doesn't only prevent it from leaking, it is also to comply with safety standards and reduce the "risk of children accidentally inhaling [them]."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167415.jpg">

9. Plastic Liners Under Bottle Caps.
Check out the blue liner. This pressure seal is softer than the plastic used for the rest of the bottle and helps ensure the freshness and carbonation of your drink.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167416.jpg">

10. Treatments With Spikes.
You're probably well aware of this one unless you found another method to open the tubes. When you purchase an OTC treatment, you might find a little spike beneath the lid. Flip it over and use it to puncture through the protective foil.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167417.jpg">

11. Bumps on the 'F' and 'J' Keys.
These bumps help keep you in line with 10-finger typing. They indicate where the index fingers should rest so you can feel for them rather than looking down, especially if you've got a lot to type.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167418.jpg">

12. Indentation on Tic Tacs Lid.
If you're a Tic Tac maniac like me, you might not find any use for this but if you've got some etiquette, use the lid as a dispenser like this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167419.jpg">

13. The Hole at the Bottom of Padlocks.
These little holes are for drainage and lubrication purposes. Take care of your padlocks and you won't have to buy a new one for years.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167420.jpg">

14. The Serrated Scribing Tool.
When using measuring tape, If you don't have a way to mark the placement of your item, you can use the serrated edge to your advantage. Just press it down and scratch it back and forth.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167421.jpg">

15. Extra Pieces of Fabric.
Sometimes manufacturers will include a sample of fabric with your item of clothing so that you can test it with different laundering techniques. If it's a valuable piece, make sure to test it out so you don't ruin it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167422.jpg">

16. Soda Can Tabs as Straw Holders.
This design is simple yet so under used. Maybe you prefer to pour your drink out of a cup or feel the cool can on your lips, but next time you have a can of soda, try using the tab as a straw holder. All you have to do is pop it open and swivel the tab around and it should stay in place.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167423.jpg">

17. The Breather Hole in Airplane Windows.
If you see a tiny hole in your window while flying, don't panic. The hole is there to regulate the amount of pressure that passes between the inner and outer panes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167424.jpg">

18. Holes on the Side of Converse Shoes.
Did you know that Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars were originally an elite basketball shoe? The holes on the sides are used for ventilation. Some folks also use it to pull the laces into a snugger fit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167425.jpg">

19. Holes in Rulers.
The next time you're holding a ruler, look for the hole or holes along the center axis. This is so you can hang the ruler up. Some rulers have more holes so you can store them in a three-ring binder.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167426.jpg">

20. The Purpose of Bi-Color Erasers.
Notice how some erasers are soft and pink on one side and firm, gritty, and blue on the other? Some say that the blue is for erasing pen but that doesn't really work. The best answer we've found is that it is used for darker pencil marks and papers of heavy weight and different textures (grainy art paper, for example).

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">15 Of The Most Polarizing Double Standards In Western Society </a>
1. “You get in before everyone else, no one notices and doesn’t care. But heaven forbid you also leave before everyone else, and you are lazy. Nope, I worked the same amount (likely more) hours than you did. Just because you weren’t here to see it, doesn’t mean I wasn’t here.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424858.jpg">

2. “Women can have sex toys and it is fun and sexy. Men have sex toys and they are losers.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424859.jpg">

3. “If I want to resign, I’m expected to give two weeks notice. If I get laid off, it’s effective immediately, no notice whatsoever.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424860.jpg">

4. “I play video games in shifts longer than four hours at a time and I’m lazy. Someone watches the entire Stranger Things series in one day and no one bats an eye.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424861.jpg">

5. “Abuse in a relationship. A couple weeks ago my now ex punched me in the face at a crowded bar and it was just a spectacle. If I (male) had been the one throwing punches, it would have been a different story. People can be awful at times.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424862.jpg">

6. “Its easier to bring drugs into most music venues than clean water. I understand the notion behind making guests dump their bottles, but it really drives me crazy how backwards security can be at a show.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424863.jpg">

7. “From when I was a kid: If I left my toys out and one of my parents stepped on them I got yelled at for not putting my toys away. But if my dad left his tools out and I stepped on one I got told to watch where I was stepping.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424864.jpg">

8. “Fat shaming is SO MEAN AND INSENSITIVE, but it’s totally fine and acceptable to tell someone they’re “TOO SKINNY. GROSS.” And that “She’s not a REAL woman.””
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424865.jpg">

9. “It’s not gender specific, but it’s common to see on dating profiles that the person requires that their partner be fit, athletic, slim, etc, while said person themselves look like the Michelin man. You should not demand your partner kill themselves at the gym on the daily while you get to be a blob.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424866.jpg">

10. “Same Road Same Rules. This is a popular slogan in the cycling community where I live. Only problem is cyclists seem to break every damn rule on the road. Weaving, passing, going through reds/stop signs, riding on the sidewalk, etc.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424867.jpg">

11. “Random women grabbed my ass so many times when I worked as a bouncer in bars. Tried to explain that this behavior is unacceptable and half the time they’d just laugh while saying I’m cute when I’m angry.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424868.jpg">

12. “I have to pass yearly workplace harassment/sensitivity training and they make a big deal about age discrimination. Here’s the kicker, age discrimination only applies to old people not young. For instance, I could get in serious trouble/fired for calling someone a dinosaur, but yet every week people tell me I should grow a beard so I look old enough to work.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424869.jpg">

13. “It’s viewed as a good thing if someone goes to bed early and get out of bed early. But if you go to bed late and therefore also wakes up later, you are a lazy bastard. But in the end, they sleep the same amount of time. And it’s always the early bird that makes comments and act like they’re Jesus because they got out of bed earlier.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424870.jpg">

14. “If I show up five minutes late to a doctors appointment I have my Appt cancelled and can be charged for it, financially not criminally, yet I can be on time and wait 45 minutes to an hour to see the doctor without receiving so much as an apology. I have gone to appointments at the VA, before I could afford insurance, and had them cancelled after waiting 30 minutes because the doctor didn’t show. Fuck the whole of U.S. healthcare.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85424871.jpg">

15. “No paternity leave! Like seriously? I can’t stay at home with the kid too?”

1. This is Larry he was a 100 years old and had 15 pounds; these unusual traits made his appear in TV.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85245019.jpg">

2. Unfortunately for Larry animal rights activists were appalled when they learned that Larry was a mascot in a restaurant and decided to ship him to the Maine State Aquarium...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85245020.jpg">

3. Yes, SHIP. iRescue wanted to send him but FedEx refused. Container was said to be leaking.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85245021.jpg">

4. The group sent Larry anyway in a new container, this time it wasn't leaking but it had only three gel packs. Larry arrived dead to the aquarium because he needed to have many gel packs in order to survive the trip. They clearly forgot that lobsters need fresh seaweed to keep them moist, and frozen ice gels to keep them cold. But at least Larry wasn't in a restaurant so he was "saved", right?

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">20 Things That Are Criminally Overpriced</a>
1. Ink jet cartridges.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320587.jpg">

2. Inhalers. I have a bad high deductible plan and pay $220 a month for something I need to breathe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320593.jpg">

3. Human pharmaceuticals. My dog needed a chelation medication that my vet specifically said was on the pricy side but recommended a pharmacy that she worked with. I called with prescription in hand, and they quoted $3,000+ for a month’s supply. Then the rep stated they accidentally read the cost for humans. Dog cost was actually $60. Same dosage, same pill count, but adding chicken flavor and putting a little dog on the label dropped the price 98%.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320584.jpg">

4. Rent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320581.jpg">

5. Feminine sanitary products. Or just products targeted towards women in general. Especially in the US, I never realised how much women were paying for pads until I visited family there. Might as well use dollar bills as pads at this stage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320585.jpg">

6. College books.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320586.jpg">

7. Anything with the word "wedding" attached. Photographer, cake, etc.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320588.jpg">

8. Funerals.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320582.jpg">

9. Airport food and drinks. $7 for a granola bar. $6.95 for water. $22 for beer. $17 for a chicken wrap. $9 for trail mix. It’s criminal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320583.jpg">

10. Ticket website service fees!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320589.jpg">

11. Mental healthcare.

12. Insulin.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320580.jpg">

13. Eyeglasses, because of a blatant monopoly. “Luxottica controls 80% of the major brands in the $28 billion global eyeglasses industry….” (Forbes).

17. I cannot understand why suitcases are so expensive. They're just plastic shells, a zip and some wheels, yet they sell for hundreds.

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">22 Food Myths People Need To Stop Believing</a>
1. Drinking a lot of fruit juice is healthy.

It's not, it contains as much if not more sugar than soda or lemonade, and often it's rid of healthy fibers from the fruits.

So better drink water and EAT 2-3 pieces of fruit per day.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241439.jpg">

2. I'm surprised no one mentioned that the food pyramid is unhealthy and a scam by the food companies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241441.jpg">

3. People believe that everything labelled ORGANIC IS ACTUALLY ORGANIC
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241448.jpg">

4. Dietitian here.
That sugar feeds cancer cells. Sugar (carbohydrates) feed ALL your cells. In fact, it's the main source of energy for your entire body. Avoiding entire food groups is going to do nothing but make you malnourished when you already have a disease that increases your body's energy needs which is going to result in worse outcomes. For the love of God, please just eat! Anything and everything that sounds good.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241460.jpg">

5. I have an advanced diploma in nutrition, it’s not a degree but still. The entire health and fitness industry is based around some guy going “this worked for me so it’s the only way to do it” the fact is if you want to lose weight etc how you do it doesn’t matter in the slightest, it’s as simple as calories in vs calories spent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241449.jpg">

6. “Healthy” foods are bland.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241444.jpg">

7. Myth: "You should wash your Chicken before cooking it".
FACT: Washing raw Chicken in the sink will spread all the bacteria over the surface. Please, don't.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241445.jpg">

8. Fat loss and muscle gain are based on a few simple and obvious principles that anyone can understand pretty easily. Calorie deficits cause fat and muscle loss, and calorie surpluses cause fat and muscle gain. In a deficit eat protein and lift weights to reduce muscle loss, and in a surplus eat protein and lift weights to increase muscle gain.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241446.jpg">

That’s pretty much it. Choosing certain diets might work better for some people than others because it’s psychologically easier to maintain nutrition goals.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241447.jpg">

Anything else is just noise created by a fitness industry that absolutely relies on making it seem like there’s more to it than the above. You don’t NEED a pre-workout, or to consume whey protein or créatine or any other supplements to make progress. As long as you’re sticking to the above you’re basically doing what you need to do.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241450.jpg">

You don’t need to optimize your macros. You don’t need to eat x amount of times per day. You don’t need to eat carbs after your workout. You don’t need to do anything else.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241451.jpg">

The obsession with perfection in workout routines and diets is also pushed by the industry to complicate things. A lot of what is pushed might give you some SLIGHT improvement in results IF you can stick to it but for pretty much anyone that isn’t a performance athlete dedicating their life to diet and exercise it’s more trouble than it’s worth.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241452.jpg">

Keep it simple. Go to the gym 3 days a week. Watch your calories and eat a decent amount of protein and that’s pretty much it for anyone looking to lose weight or gain muscle.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241453.jpg">

9. * No, that gum you swallowed as a kid is not still there. indigestible materials pass through your gut just as fast as anything else. it won't just magically hover there in your intestine as food forces it's way past.
* colon cleansing is a complete scam. the colon is a self-cleaning organ.
* Anything that has to do with blood pH is a scam. your body goes through great pains to keep that number exactly where it needs to be, since you'll die if it gets even *one degree* off.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241442.jpg">

10. Cold water does not make you gain weight. It's water. It has 0 calories
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241454.jpg">

11. Carbs aren't evil unnatural things that trick your body into gaining weight. Food high in carbs is usually pretty tasty. Its a lot easier to eat a lot of something when its tasty.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241455.jpg">

12. Starvation diets do not work in the long term. Yes, you will lose weight in the short-term but once you stop your starvation diet, you gain the weight back plus more. This is known as ''yo-yo' dieting.

The word 'diet' does not mean eating to lose weight, rather it means what you eat as a habit. For example, the SAD (Standard American Diet) is a diet which one wants to avoid.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241456.jpg">

13. Fat makes you fat.
Muscle weighs more than fat.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241457.jpg">

14. Anything billed as a "superfood" just has a little bit higher levels of some nutrient than other foods. They're not magic and they don't make other, unhealthy foods healthier.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241440.jpg">

15. Agrarian here. Had "Food Science" among my classes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241458.jpg">

The "2000 calories" recommendation isn't a universal indicator. It assumes you're an adult with an active lifestyle: a job five days a week, walking, doing chores daily, and exercising on the weekend. It's a lifestyle that maintains your metabolism high and functional.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87241459.jpg">

If you live a sedentary lifestyle, your metabolism goes down, reducing your body's ability to take energy from stored fats. Your muscles lose mass, reducing your calorie intake need as well (muscles require more calories than fat to maintain). So if you're sedentary, your actual calorie deficit can be much lower than 1900 calories. This also leads your brain to develop the habit of replenishing lost energy with immediate food intake rather than taking it from your fat storage, which means you get hungrier when you're tired (the reason why exercise makes you feel like starving when you're a beginner). It's a vicious cycle.

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Mom Who Was Shamed For Breastfeeding by a Cop Gets a Reply From The Sheriff</a>
1. His argument was founded on his claim that he could see a little areola.

From there things escalated rather quickly — he actually threatened to arrest her and then shamed her into finishing the feeding in her car.
She was so upset, she took to Facebook to post about the incident where it's been shared almost 15,000 times.

September 26 at 8:11am ·

Good Morning,

I have seen and am aware of a post circulating Facebook, regarding a situation between a Muscogee County deputy and a woman attempting to breastfeed her young child. My wife and I have four children, each of whom were breastfed, and two of my daughters now have small children of their own. Therefore, I fully understand and appreciate the right of a woman to feed her child wherever she is most comfortable. It is also the law in the state of Georgia. We are currently looking into this incident and it will be addressed. Our office does not condone these actions and will ensure all officers know and understand the law. On behalf of the Muscogee County Sheriff's Office, I would like to personally extend an apology to the woman involved, and we hope that she knows that these are not the opinions or practices of the office as a whole.

Roxanne Lenae Phillips That's the problem now days the cops are not properly trained on the laws or how to handle situations. Women should be able to feed their babies anywhere without any shame. If it was your screaming baby hungry you would want him/her feed. But cops can make mistakes and its no big deal but we citizens make a mistake or drive 5 over the speed limit or silly things we have to pay for them.

Chris Allen I would add to the good sheriff here, it's not just about the woman's comfort; it's also about the hungry baby's comfort. :)

Chia NT We don't care if your children were breastfed. This isn't about you! This is about your department's inability to ensure that officers are aware of ALL laws they attempt to "enforce"; and, in this case, your officer is clearly going out of his way to s...See More

Simon Boterkooper Dus het klopt wat je ziet in elke Amerikaanse tv series. Jullie zijn zo bang voor tepels dat vrouwen tijdens de sex hun bh aanhouden. En maar klagen over moslima's met een hoofddoek. Trieste mensen daar aan de andere kant van de plas.

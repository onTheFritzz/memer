## <a href="#link4" id="link3">The Craziest Things Confiscated By The TSA</a>
1. This conversation must have gone something like this: "Sorry, sir, but spearguns are not allowed on the plane..." OBVIOUSLY.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108043.jpg">

2. This is a World War II blasting machine taken off someone in Atlanta, GA.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108044.jpg">

3. Who honestly tries to bring a cannon in their carry-on?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108045.jpg">

4. That's a cane that also doubles as a stun gun.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108046.jpg">

5. Just imagine someone actually trying to use bear spray in the enclosed environment of an airplane? No thanks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108047.jpg">

6. Someone in Vermont honestly thought they could board a plane with this giant wooden mallet.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108048.jpg">

7. Of course, people also try to sneak in plenty of hidden knives...like this one concealed in a lipstick case.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108049.jpg">

8. Phone case or knife?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108050.jpg">

9. Yes, that is a mini saw hiding inside a Bible.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108051.jpg">

10. Even though everything on TV and in movies says you can't smuggle drugs onto a plane, that doesn't stop everyone. These guys tried to smuggle cocaine aboard by hiding it in some raw meat.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108052.jpg">

11. Hollowing out school books isn't a very effective drug smuggling method.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108053.jpg">

12. Then, of course, you have the people trying to bring their sword canes on the plane.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108054.jpg">

13. Obviously you're going to get caught with this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108055.jpg">

14. Seriously?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108056.jpg">

15. Even though it should be common knowledge that you can't bring your gun with you on a plane, people still try. This is America, after all.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108057.jpg">

16. Think the attempted gun smugglers are bad? They're nothing compared to the attempted grenade smugglers.

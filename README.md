## <a href="#link3" id="link2">16 Fascinating and Rare Photos of Celebrities</a>
1. Lilian Bond posing for a publicity picture in the early 1930s. One of Hollywood's first sex symbols, she did numerous photo shoots that for the time were considered more risqué than pin up model shoots and other shoots, even posing nude in beautifully done artistic shots very evident of the era. She did films for nearly 30 years, retiring in 1958.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85355525.jpg">

2. Dave Navarro with his date for the night, porn actress Jayme Langford, at an event in 2016. The internet blew up with the story she was actually his daughter, but this is false. In fact, she was just another girl on the list of pornstars he has been with including Sasha Grey, Jenna Haze, Stormy Daniels, Tila Tequila, Jenna Jameson, Brittany Skye and numerous others.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85355526.jpg">

3. No, that's not Marilyn Monroe, but one of her clones Jeanne Carmen in a photo shoot in the late 1950s. Carmen was not much of an actress but did plenty of modeling. What I find interesting here is she is part of a huge group of women who literally modeled themselves after Marilyn Monroe. Monroe was so huge, tons of other girls wanted to be her, and some literally tried. There have been incidents of people posing as Marilyn at events all throughout the 1950s and early 60s, even after the icons death in 1962. Jeanne Carmen is a prime example of at least an established clone, as some of her modelling shoots are incredibly similar to Monroe's. Even today we still occasionally see actresses and models trying to channel Monroe's iconic style and look.

4. Jonah Hill attends an event with his girlfriend Ali Hoffman in 2012. Hoffman is Dustin Hoffman's daughter.

5. Tony Randall (right) doing his impression of a cocktail party pest "the confider" during a funny photo shoot in 1957. Randall had a successful career for nearly 40 years, mostly in TV.

6. Michelle Williams and her boyfriend Health Ledger attend a basketball game in 2006.

7. 17 Year old Scarlett Johansson and her twin brother Hunter Johansson attend the Nintendo Gamecube launch party in 2001. Scarlett has an older sister and a half brother as well, all whom she is close with. Her older sister Vanessa Johansson also acts, but has done very little. Hunter doesn't act.

8. Lillian Gish, D.W. Griffith, and Dorothy Gish pose for a publicity photo in 1922. The sisters were maybe the first actress family to make it big in the silent film era, with Lillian arguable being the greatest silent film actress of all time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85355532.jpg">

9. Kelsey Grammer with his girlfriend Kayte Walsh in 2010. Grammer started dating Walsh while still married to Camille Grammer whom he had been with the past 14 years.

12. Marge Champion showing off her flexibility for a publicity shot sometime in the early 1950s. Marge and her then husband Gower Champion were a terrific dance team duo and choreographers for the MGM musicals of the time period.

14. Martha Crawford Cantarini being thrown from her horse during a scene for a film sometime in the mid 1950s. Martha Crawford, as she was known throughout her career, was never an actress nor a model. She was just one of the best female stunt women (specifically doing horse riding work) in the business. She worked on 17 films in just 3 years.

15. Dawn Wells at the 2004 TV Land Awards. She was 66 in this picture and looked so much like her character from Gilligan's Island still. She was Miss Nevada in 1959, and competed for the 1960 Miss America pageant. This helped start her career the following year, which was mostly in TV. Despite numerous roles even to this day, she is never remembered for anything else but her 1 iconic character Mary Ann.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">20 Things That Are Criminally Overpriced</a>
1. Ink jet cartridges.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320587.jpg">

2. Inhalers. I have a bad high deductible plan and pay $220 a month for something I need to breathe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320593.jpg">

3. Human pharmaceuticals. My dog needed a chelation medication that my vet specifically said was on the pricy side but recommended a pharmacy that she worked with. I called with prescription in hand, and they quoted $3,000+ for a month’s supply. Then the rep stated they accidentally read the cost for humans. Dog cost was actually $60. Same dosage, same pill count, but adding chicken flavor and putting a little dog on the label dropped the price 98%.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320584.jpg">

4. Rent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320581.jpg">

5. Feminine sanitary products. Or just products targeted towards women in general. Especially in the US, I never realised how much women were paying for pads until I visited family there. Might as well use dollar bills as pads at this stage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320585.jpg">

6. College books.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320586.jpg">

7. Anything with the word "wedding" attached. Photographer, cake, etc.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320588.jpg">

8. Funerals.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320582.jpg">

9. Airport food and drinks. $7 for a granola bar. $6.95 for water. $22 for beer. $17 for a chicken wrap. $9 for trail mix. It’s criminal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320583.jpg">

10. Ticket website service fees!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320589.jpg">

11. Mental healthcare.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320590.jpg">

12. Insulin.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320580.jpg">

13. Eyeglasses, because of a blatant monopoly. “Luxottica controls 80% of the major brands in the $28 billion global eyeglasses industry….” (Forbes).

16. Bottled water. Seriously it's water. Turn the tap and it's free.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320594.jpg">

17. I cannot understand why suitcases are so expensive. They're just plastic shells, a zip and some wheels, yet they sell for hundreds.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87320595.jpg">

18. Diamonds.

19. Anyone Christmas shopping right now might notice how ridiculously expensive kids toys are.

20. Baby formula, if you can find it.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Innocent Man Who Survived 22 Years On Death Row Tells Of His Experience</a>
1. Nick Yarris was sentenced in 1981, for the rape and murder of Linda Mae Craig and served 22 years in solitary confinement before being released from death row in 2004.  Yarris was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day for 22 very long years, and read around 9,400 books as he educated himself about the law so he could prove his lack of guilt. "I was showing them an unbelievable brilliance beyond what they would expect," Yarris said. "When they imagine someone on death row, they think of some terrible loser guy, who isn't going to have anything to say. "They don't think it's going to be someone that would wow them, and I have."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85393539.jpg">

2. In 1981, at age 20, Yarris was arrested for the kidnap and murder of a police officer after being pulled over in a stolen car. To get off the charges, his drug-laden mind decided to tell officers that he knew who had murdered a woman, Linda Mae Craig, whose case he had seen covered in the papers. He gave them the name of a man he thought was dead, but after his lie was caught, Yarris was charged with the crimes himself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85393540.jpg">

3. In 1988, when DNA testing was first introduced, Yarris made his first attempt at clearing his name. However, he spent many more years inside jail awaiting the results of his DNA test after the sample he gave the lab broke. And in 2002, when Yarris was at the end of his ropes he finally begged the judge if he could die. But before doing so the judge asked if the DNA could be tested one last time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85393537.png">

4. And after 22 long years Yarris was found not-guilty of the crimes with which he was charged and so he was released, a free man once again.  Yarris received compensation upon his release, which he called 'pity money', and is now on his way to Hollywood to film a biopic about his life. Now that's the smile of a freeman!

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">52 Pulitzer Prize Winning Photographs That Are Simply Amazing</a>
1. 1942: Milton Brooks –“Ford Strikers Riot.”  In April of 1941, a worker was fired from the Ford Motor plant in Detroit, MI. A few days later, tensions had built among the employees, and picketers walked the street encouraging other workers to leave and inciting the first strike in the history of Ford Motors. One plant employee attempted to push past the picketers and into the building (against the advice of the State Police and Ford Service men), and his confrontation with the picketers became heated. Within a matter of minutes, the “time man” and the picketers were fighting, the man attempting to cover his head and face with his coat. The man was injured, dazed, and taken to the plant hospital for treatment.

2. 1943: Frank Noel – “Water.”  In January of 1942, photographer Frank Noel was covering British troops in Singapore. The Pacific War was going badly and Japanese planes were beginning to bomb the city. Noel had contracted malaria and was in the process of being shipped back to the United States when the freighter he was traveling on was hit by a Japanese torpedo. The ship went down in the Indian Ocean and Noel managed to escape and board a life vessel with 27 survivors.  The group drifted aimlessly for five days in scorching heat. During the disaster, a separate lifeboat of survivors approached the men explaining that they had lost their water supply in the rush to escape from the boat. As they neared Noel’s boat one of the sailors reached out his hand and begged for water. Sadly, they had none to offer.

3. 1944: Earle Bunker – “Homecoming.”  The Omaha World-Herald's photo, taken in Villisca, Iowa, on July 15, 1943, Lt. Col Robert Moore is greeted by his wife, Dorothy Dee Moore, and daughter Nancy, 7. At left is a young nephew Michael Croxdale.

6. 1948: Frank Cushing – “Boy Gunman and Hostage.”  In June 1947, Frank Cushing sat in his car outside a restaurant, waiting to photograph robbery victims. Then Cushing heard an alert coming from the radio of a parked police car. A shooting had taken place just down the street.
Two police officers had stopped 15 year old Ed Bancroft and questioned him about the robbery. Suddenly the boy pulled a pistol and started shooting. He shot one policeman in the arm and fled to an alley, where he grabbed a hostage, another 15 year old named Bill Ronan.
The police blocked the ends of the alley to cut off Bancroft’s escape, but he threated to shoot Ronan if the police came closer. He fired several times at police and repeatedly shoved the gun into Ronan’s back.
Eventually, there were about 30 police in the area. One of them worked his way along the fence to a spot where Bancroft was making his stand. The cop stood up behind Bancroft, reached over the fence, and hit him with the butt of a weapon. The dazed youth, who had nothing to do with the robbery, was taken into custody.

7. 1949: Nathaniel Fein – “The Babe Bows Out.”  He was the greatest ballplayer of them all, the towering Sultan of Swat. But by 1948, Babe Ruth had been out of the game for more than a decade and was struggling with terminal cancer. So when the beloved Bambino stood before a massive crowd on June 13 to help celebrate the silver anniversary of Yankee Stadium—known to all in attendance as the House That Ruth Built—and to retire his No. 3, it was clear this was a final public goodbye.
Nat Fein walked behind Ruth, where he saw the proud ballplayer leaning on a bat, his thin legs hinting at the toll the disease had wreaked on his body. From that spot, Fein captured the almost mythic role that athletes play in our lives—even at their weakest, they loom large. Two months later Ruth was dead, and Fein went on to win a Pulitzer Prize for his picture. It was the first one awarded to a sports photographer, giving critical legitimacy to a form other than hard-news reportage.

8. 1950: Bill Crouch – “Near Miss at Airshow.”  Pilot Chet Derby was carrying out a loop-the-loop in a biplane before a crowd of 60,000. Three B-29 Super Fortresses were supposed to fly through Derby's smoke trail, but the B-29s came in too early and the biplane came within five feet of hitting the B-29's wing.

9. 1951:  Max Desfor – “Flight of Refugees.”  In bitter cold, residents from Pyongyang, North Korea, and refugees of other areas crawl over precarious, tangled girders of a bridge across the Taedong River on Dec. 4, 1950, as they flee south ahead of advancing Chinese Communist troops fighting on the side of North Korea.

10. 1952:  John Robinson and Don Ultang – “Sequence of Six Pictures.”  In 1951, racial tensions remained high in the United States and were spilling into the racially-integrated world of college football. Johnny Bright was one of the first black players. Bright’s future seemed assured when in his senior year, he was on the short list for Heisman Trophy candidates. Playing for Drake University in the game against Oklahoma A&M, Bright was repeatedly violently attacked by white players including defensive tackle Wilbanks Smith, who used racially derogatory language against Bright and incited his teammates to target Bright. 
In a series of aggressive tackles during the first seven minutes of the game, Bright was knocked unconscious three times. In the final hit from Smith, Bright’s jaw was broken. Because of the injury, he was forced to leave the game.
A series of six images taken by cameramen Don Ultang and John Robinson clearly showed that the hits against Bright were made long after the hand-off of the football. The two photographers had decided to focus on Bright because of the rumors of him being targeted, and the effort was well worth it. Because of these direct assaults, the NCAA changed the rules about protective gear and declared that all players must wear protective helmets with faceguards. The series of photos was published in the Des Moines Register, eventually made the cover of Life Magazine, and won them the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for photography.

11. 1945: Joe Rosenthal – “Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima.”  U.S. Marines raise the American flag atop Mt. Suribachi on the Japanese Island of Iwo Jima, Feb. 23, 1945. Three of the men in the photo were later killed in fighting on the island.

12. 1954:  Virginia Schau – “A Thrilling Rescue.” Paul Overby, one of two drivers trapped in the cab of a tractor trailer, is pulled to safety by a rope on the Pit River Bridge across Shasta Lake near Redding, Calif., May 3, 1953. Both Overby and co-driver Hank Baum were rescued before the cab burned and fell to the rocks below. Virginia Schau, an amateur photographer, used a Kodak Brownie camera to shoot the photo.

13. 1955:  John Gaunt – “Tragedy by the Sea.”  April 2, J 954. Photographer John Gaunt lounges in his front yard in Hermosa Beach, Calif. A neighbor calls out. "Something is happening on the beach," says Gaunt. "I grabbed a RoIIeiflex camera and ran."
Down by the water, Gaunt finds a distraught young couple by the shoreline. Moments before, their 19-month-old son was playing in the sand. Somehow, he was swept away by the tide.
The little boy is gone, there is nothing anyone can do. Gaunt, who has a daughter about the same age, takes four quick photographs of the grieving couple. "As I made the last exposure, they turned and walked away" he says. The little boy’s body was later recovered about a mile away.

14. 1956:  George Mattson – “B-26 bomber Crashes in Street.”  A B-26 from nearby Mitchell Field burns in the street and on the lawn in East Meadow, L.I., after crashing in front of a house in 1955. Two on board were killed.

15. 1957:  Harry Trask – “The Sinking of the Andrea Doria.”  Its passengers are enjoying their last night at sea - dining, dancing, playing cards - as the luxury liner Andrea Doria sails through fog-bound waters. It is 11 p.m., July 25, 1956. The ship is just off Nantucket; it should be in New York by morning.
Cruising out of New York Harbor is the Stockholm, a Swedish-American liner, its prow heavily reinforced against winter ice. Each ship spots the other on radar. Both radar screens indicate that they will pass safely.

He was unusual in postwar Japan for his forceful advocacy of socialism, and his support of the Chinese Communist Party was particularly controversial.
Asanuma was assassinated during a televised political debate for the coming elections for the House of Representatives. While Asanuma spoke from the lectern at Tokyo’s Hibiya Hall, Yamaguchi rushed onstage and ran his yoroidōshi (a traditional samurai sword) through Asanuma’s ribs on the left side, killing him.

20. 1962:  Paul Vathis – “Serious Steps.”  After his election into office, President John F. Kennedy faced many challenges. Among them was a communist stronghold in Cuba that was causing the United States a great deal of concern. When Kennedy was approached with a plan to invade Cuba, he allowed it as long as American involvement would be kept secret. The failed operation later became known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion.
The invasion was a serious moment for Kennedy and international politics. Cuban forces had become aware of the operation and had planned a counter-attack. When the American forces landed on Cuban soil, they met with heavy resistance and suffered significant losses. Kennedy, who was with his family at Camp David, was joined by Eisenhower to discuss the severity of the situation. Paul Vathis followed the two as they walked and talked.
The photo he shot of the two men from behind discussing the future of the world and their fears was entitled “Serious Steps.” It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for photography in 1962 after its publication showed the weight and gravity of Kennedy’s presidency.

The truth is, I don’t know how I took those pictures, lying on the ground.” Rondon photographed the government soldier crawling his way up Navy chaplain Luis Padilla’s robe as Padilla looked in the direction of the rebel sniper fire.

39. 1977:  Stanley Forman – “The Soiling of Old Glory.”  Stanley Forman was covering an anti-busing demonstration at Boston City Hall when he managed to capture a photograph that would later become iconic. The photograph depicts teenager Joseph Rakes assaulting lawyer and civil rights activist Ted Landsmark with a flagpole bearing the American flag.  Landsmark was active in trying to get more minority contractors in the construction industry, and was on his way to a meeting in the courthouse.  According to Landsmark: “I approached a corner where the young demonstrators were coming in the other direction. I did not see them until both they and I were at that corner.”
Rakes was swinging the flag and trying to hit him, not trying to spear him as it appears in the photo, and he narrowly missed. Landsmark was bloodied during the incident. An examination of all the photographs in the roll Forman shot reveals that Rakes missed Landsmark with the flag. Landsmark had already been knocked to the ground, losing his glasses and suffering a broken nose.  When he got up, the famous picture was taken.
Rakes was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to two years imprisonment and two years probation. The jail sentence was suspended. In 1983 the Boston police issued a warrant alleging that Rakes had beaten to death the brother of his girlfriend. He fled prosecution, but returned in 1988 after the murder charge was dropped. Rakes carried the stigma of being known as “the flag kid”, but eventually turned his life around, getting married and having a family as a construction worker.

Bill Foley heads for the Palestinian refugee camp at Sabra, which is run by the Christian militia.  “There were guys with guns at the gates – Christian militiamen who said ‘Take a hike if you don’t want to get your head blown off.’  I went back on Friday, the men were still there.  There was shooting going on inside.”
On Saturday, Foley returns again to find the guards gone and the gates open.  Foley finds the streets piled with bodies.  “You’d see it was a pile of people, not a pile of garbage.  You’d see people having dinner; they had been shot at the table.  Women with their hands tied behind their backs, throats cut.”

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">22 Fascinating Photos Collected From History</a>
1. Robert McGee, scalped as a child by Sioux Chief Little Turtle in 1864.

Although the custom of “scalping” was once practiced in Europe and Asia, it is generally associated with North American native groups. In scalping, the skin around the crown of the head was cut and removed from the enemy’s skull, usually causing death. In addition to its value as a war trophy, a scalp was often believed to bestow the possessor with the powers of the scalped enemy. In their early wars with Native Americans, European colonists of North America retaliated against hostile native groups by adopting their practice of scalp taking. Bounties were offered for them by colonial authorities, which in turn led to an escalation of intertribal warfare and scalping in North America.

2. Adolf Hitler informs Czech President Emil Hácha of the imminent German invasion of Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939 in Berlin. Hácha suffered a heart attack during the meeting, and had to be kept awake by medical staff, eventually giving in and accepting Hitler’s surrender terms.

In the evening of 14 March 1939, Hitler invited President Hácha to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. Hitler deliberately kept him waiting for hours, while Hitler watched a film. Finally, at 1:30 a.m., on 15 March 1939, Hitler saw the President. He told Hácha that as they were speaking, the German army was about to invade Czechoslovakia. All of Czechoslovakia’s defences were now under German control following the Munich Agreement in September of the previous year. The country was virtually surrounded by Germany on three fronts.
Hitler now gave the President two options: cooperate with Germany, in which case the “entry of German troops would take place in a tolerable manner” and “permit Czechoslovakia a generous life of her own, autonomy and a degree of national freedom…” or face a scenario in which “resistance would be broken by force of arms, using all means.” By four o’clock, after suffering a heart attack induced by Göring’s threat to bomb the capital, Hácha contacted Prague, effectively “signing Czechoslovakia away” to Germany. French Ambassador Robert Coulondre reported that by half past four, Hácha was “in a state of total collapse, and kept going only by means of injections.”

11. The Allied crossing of the St Quentin Canal in 1918. 

The photo shows General J V Campbell on Riqueval Bridge, addressing men of the 46th North Midland Division following their successful assault of the St Quentin Canal on 29th September 1918.
At this point, the canal flowed through a 50 feet deep cutting, the east bank of which, the Germans had fortified with emplaced machine guns, barbed wire and bunkers. It was a strongpoint of the German Hindenburg Line which they considered impregnable. The British decision to attack it was made at the last minute and was intended to divert German attention from another assault taking place further north which involved greener Allied troops.
The morning of the assault was very misty which provided cover to the attacking troops but made it difficult descending to the canal. The Germans, aware of the impending assault, swept the western bank with pre-sighted fire.
Despite this, the assaulting troops used ropes to lower themselves down the bank where they had to cut through barbed wire to reach the canal. Here they used collapsible boats and life preservers to swarm to the other bank before having to attack up a near vertical face in the face of furious German resistances.
At the same time, a company strength, forlorn hope rushed the bridge in the photo. They had to clamber through coils of barbed wire with little cover beyond the bridge parapet. They managed to drive off the German engineers before they were able to fire the explosives already placed along the roadway.
The bridge and bank were both carried and the impregnable Hindenburg Line was breached at this point.

20. The Quartermaster Corps (QMC) of the United States Army begins training dogs for the newly established War Dog Program, or “K-9 Corps.” 1942.

The K-9 Corps initially accepted over 30 breeds of dogs, but the list was soon narrowed to seven: German Shepherds, Belgian sheep dogs, Doberman Pinschers, collies, Siberian Huskies, Malumutes and Eskimo dogs. Members of the K-9 Corps were trained for a total of 8 to 12 weeks. After basic obedience training, they were sent through one of four specialized programs to prepare them for work as sentry dogs, scout or patrol dogs, messenger dogs or mine-detection dogs. In active combat duty, scout dogs proved especially essential by alerting patrols to the approach of the enemy and preventing surprise attacks. – The top canine hero of World War II was Chips, a German Shepherd who served with the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division. Trained as a sentry dog, Chips broke away from his handlers and attacked an enemy machine gun nest in Italy, forcing the entire crew to surrender. The wounded Chips was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star and the Purple Heart–all of which were later revoked due to an Army policy preventing official commendation of animals.

22. Adolf Hitler in 1915, 1916, 1919, 1921.

In 1918 a British soldier allegedly spares the life of an injured Adolf Hitler in World War 1 – Private Henry Tandey, a British soldier serving near the French village of Marcoing, reportedly encounters a wounded German soldier and declines to shoot him, sparing the life of 29-year-old Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler. –
As Tandey later told sources, during the final moments of that battle, as the German troops were in retreat, a wounded German soldier entered Tandey’s line of fire. “I took aim but couldn’t shoot a wounded man,” Tandey remembered, “so I let him go.” The German soldier nodded in thanks, and disappeared. –
Though sources do not exist to prove the exact whereabouts of Adolf Hitler on that day in 1918, an intriguing link emerged to suggest that he was in fact the soldier Tandey spared. A photograph that appeared in London newspapers of Tandey carrying a wounded soldier at Ypres in 1914 was later portrayed on canvas in a painting by the Italian artist Fortunino Matania glorifying the Allied war effort. As the story goes, when British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain traveled to Germany in 1938 to engage Hitler in a last-ditch effort to avoid another war in Europe, he was taken by the führer to his new country retreat in Bavaria. There, Hitler showed Chamberlain his copy of the Matania painting, commenting, “That’s the man who nearly shot me.”

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">19 Fascinating Photos From Our History's Vault</a>
1. Model Kathryn Stanley holds a prop head for an artistic picture in 1926. The picture is done by Edwin Bower Hesser who helped redefine art, sex appeal, and imagination in the 1920s. Look him up, his unique grasp on photography, art, and the beauty, especially of women, was ahead of its time.

2. Local businessmen destroy a Japanese made car in 1988. Other American car companies suffered in the 1980s as Japanese vehicles were cheaper and more reliable. Some major US car companies even had to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to avoid going under. In response, American business owners large and small made a heavy "Buy American" push in the late 1980s as the quality of Japanese goods soared. Japanese currency and international business influence also rose drastically, and this forced the American companies, especially the car companies, to improve their quality, which some did. The push however worked for many companies, and to this day many people take pride buying a sometimes inferior product, possibly even for more money, as long as it was made in America.

3. 3 Portuguese soldiers laugh as a child shines their shoes in Angola in 1972. This was part of the Portuguese Colonial War that lasted 13 years until 1975. Despite at the time Portugal was winning the ongoing war, major political problems at home and increased pressure from other nations forced them to withdraw from Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea, eventually granting each nation their independence.

4. A couple of models show off a new style of outfits in Paris, France in 1970. As you can tell from the onlookers, the bright colors and designs are completely different than anything that came before.

5. Soldiers pose on top of the discarded shells from fired rounds after a bombardment of an enemy position in the Korean War in 1952.

6. Men prepare to show off their goods at a local market in Tunisia in 1891. The area, like much of North Africa at the time, is under French control. You can see the French officer on the right overseeing the area.

7. Soldiers injured in a recent bombardment get treatment during WWI in 1916. This is the complete photo, as most have only seen the man sitting on the left in close ups. He is the famous WWI shell shocked soldier. Notice his eyes are focused in a scary gaze at the camera as he appears to have fallen into madness.

8. Detectives look for clues after the body of Gaspare Candella was found in a drum in a field in NYC, US in 1918.  This was one of the earlier well known and documented mafia murders in the US.

9. Children play on a war torn street in Madrid, Spain in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. The war would last another 3 years, and was not only major for Spain of course but the world, as many countries including Nazi Germany, the UK, and France sent advisors and watched the fighting play out with modern weapons.

12. John Henry Patterson poses with the first of 2 lions he killed at Tsavo, British Eash Africa (now Kenya) in 1898. The lions hunted together, and attacked the railroad workers. Originally it was believed they killed over 100, but modern estimates put it at more like 30. Still, a surprising large number of dead for the 2 man eaters who wreaked havoc before Patterson eventually killed them both. The film The Ghost and the Darkness portrays this event.

13. Soldiers pose with captured Japanese flags at the end of the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. The 6 month campaign was brutal, with the soldiers completely cut off at times continuing to fight an enemy that never stopped. This victory was huge, as it stopped the Japanese advance in their tracks, but showed how horrific the Pacific fight on every island would be. That appears to be very evident on the men's faces in this picture.

14. A French military policeman using a metal detector checks for weapons from civilians heading into town in Algeria in 1956. This was during the brutal Algerian War of Independence, when systematic assassinations and executions, torture, bombings, and attacks of domestic civilians on both sides dominated the fighting. Large scale battles were rare, and 1 million Europeans living in Algeria fled. This was part of the numerous countries post WWII who pushed for independence from European control. Algeria, being so close to France and having 150 years of integration already, was one of the countries France really wanted to keep. Vietnam would be another.

15. 3 Japanese teens show the Wings sign and also show their tickets to a cancelled Wings concert in Toyko, Japan in 1980. The concert was cancelled when Paul McCartney was arrested at the airport after he was found with marijuana in his luggage. The tickets cost around $20 USD at the time. These fans loved Wings, but when the journalist asked them if they also liked The Beatles, the young girls had little to no clue about McCartney's former band.

16. Soldiers who are part of the international coalition to free Kuwait after Iraq had invaded it stand next to a knocked out tank after the Battle of 73 Easting in the Gulf War in 1991. The Iraqi armor was so outdated the coalition absolutely obliterated any who did not run. Some 160 Iraqi tanks, 180 Iraqi personnel carriers, and 80 other Iraqi wheeled vehicles were destroyed, along with around 1,000 Iraqi soldiers killed. The coalition lost 2 vehicles, 1 to friendly fire, and had officially 1 killed. Some tank crews compared it to shooting fish in a barrel.

18. Adolf Hitler reacts to being kissed from a very excited American woman during the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin, Germany. German idealism was accepted and even in some circles popular in the US, before they invaded their neighbors, slaughter millions of innocent people, and became the enemy of the world.

19. The Kaibiles, a special counterinsurgency force of the Guatemalan army that would eventually be accused of human rights violations, march in Guatemala City, Guatemala, in 1988. If you read up on what these guys did, its almost unthinkable in many ways the atrocities they did to their own people. Most of their actions occurred during the 35 year Guatemalan Civil War that finally ended in 1996.

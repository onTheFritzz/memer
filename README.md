2. Married Texas teacher Sarah Fowlkes couldn’t wipe the smile off her face for her mugshot after being accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student, the Houston Chronicle reported.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/85302084.jpg">

3. Detectives launched the investigation on March 10 after getting a tip from a school administrator. They've found proof that the pretty teacher had a relationship with one of her students. “Their contact was of a sexual nature,” police said.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/85302082.jpg">

4. “I have very high expectations of myself as a teacher as well as of my students and I hope that this will be a formula for achievement,” Fowlkes wrote on the school's website.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/85302083.jpg">

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">Dude Discovers A Hidden Dungeon Under His New Apartment</a>
1. So far I love the place, look at the high ceilings in the kitchen/living area.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398383.jpg">

2. In order to maximize the space in the cavernous building, they built a second level in his apartment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398384.jpg">

3. Yep, that’s his bedroom. Wouldn’t want to even try sleeping off a night of drinking on that thing. I get the bed spins pretty bad, and it looks like if he falls out of bed, he dies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398385.jpg">

4. The bathroom is decent; stand up shower, small sink… assume there’s a toilet.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398386.jpg">

5. Wait, there’s something on the floor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398387.jpg">

6. And that, urban explorers, in case you’re wondering, is the handle to a trapdoor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398388.jpg">

7. Against better judgement, he opens it up. He says this wasn’t mentioned anywhere on the lease, or even when the place was shown to him prior to the rental.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398389.jpg">

8. At first glance, it looks like some underfloor storage for some old tools and paint. Seems pretty unexciting. It’s not as if it could be hiding anything more creepy or nefarious, right? It’s a small, cheap studio apartment in an old monastery.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398390.jpg">

9. Except when you look at it from the bathroom, there’s a scary dark space that looks like it goes deeper.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398391.jpg">

10. Yep, those are stairs. Stairs that go down into a dark, stone-lined space below an old, medieval/Victorian building in England.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398392.jpg">

11. It’s a dungeon. An actual freaking dungeon below his place, that possibly spanned the footprint of the building. He wasn’t brave enough to do it alone, so he wedged his bathroom door over the closed hatch and called a friend.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398393.jpg">

12. Once the friend arrived, the headed downstairs. What they found was a proper 19th century layout of corridors, hatches and rooms underneath.

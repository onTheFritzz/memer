## <a href="#link6" id="link5">Couple Finds Hidden Treasure In New House</a>
1. While moving all their stuff into their new house, Matt stacked some boxes into an empty closet, not paying much attention to the floor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089448.jpg">

2. While Matt was pretty oblivious to the secret hiding under the cardboard boxes, his wife noticed a panel in the floor and said to him, "Did you know we had a trapdoor?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089449.jpg">

3. Super curious, they quickly moved the boxes out of the way and Matt tried the handle...hoping not to find any dead bodies below.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089450.jpg">

4. The trapdoor opened easy but it looked like there was nothing but dust to be found down there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089451.jpg">

5. But wait...what's that hiding in the corner?!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089452.jpg">

6. A box!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089453.jpg">

7. This intricate little box was sitting on plastic sheeting.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089454.jpg">

8. They tried to open it only to realize it was locked tight. Not having any idea how old and delicate it was they decided not to force it open and risk ruining the box itself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089455.jpg">

9. It was surprisingly heavy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089456.jpg">

10. Since the keyhole appeared to be intact, Matt decided to leave the box and call up a locksmith friend for help.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089457.jpg">

11. Here's a close-up of the keyhole.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089458.jpg">

12. After finding out his locksmith friend wasn't coming to explore the unopened box, overly curious Matt decided he had to try to force it open and see what was hiding inside. He grabbed his tools and got to work!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089459.jpg">

13. Using a screwdriver and a hammer, Matt got the box open in no time at all.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041457/85261674/3.jpg">

14. Oh wow! It was a little treasure chest!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089460.jpg">

15. What excited Matt and his wife the most was when they found a tiny box within the bigger one.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089461.jpg">

16. This probably explains why the thing was so heavy...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089462.jpg">

17. Here's a close-up of some of the coins, including a British 50 pence coin.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089463.jpg">

18. Some of the coins appeared to be very old, and on closer inspection...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089464.jpg">

19. ...yes, they were old! This one was over 130 years old!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089465.jpg">

20. This one cent coin was incredibly from 1859.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089466.jpg">

21. Most of the coins were American, but there were some from all corners of the world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089467.jpg">

22. While looking through the coins, Matt's wife spotted something else...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089468.jpg">

23. It was this awesome retro Silver Surfer card in a protective case.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041520/85261676/1.jpg">

24. While the coins and card were cool, there was something else in there...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041509/85261675/2.jpg">

25. ...that other tiny box!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089469.jpg">

26. What's that? Seems like this box had been outfitted with some serious tiny-lock technology.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089470.jpg">

27. Luckily, Matt's wife found the key among all the coins...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089471.jpg">

28. Tiny mystery boxeth unlocketh!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089472.jpg">

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Parents Found Something In Their Daughter's Toy That Is Horrifying Beyond Belief</a>
1. Dollar stores have aisles filled with inexpensive toys promising to give hours of entertainment.They can be a gold mine for awesome presents, or in this case can be something more sinister.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093372.jpg">

2. This pink wand looks harmless enough, though it is called an Evil Stick.The packaging has an anime character and snowflakes. It looks more like a princess wand in the shape of a flower than something dark and evil.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093373.jpg">

3. One mom in Dayton, Ohio purchased this toy for her toddler. She didn't put much thought on the image behind the mirror-looking sticker.Nicole Allen picked the wand sitting among Barbies and baby toys.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093374.jpg">

4. The photo in the package promises that a unicorn will be revealed when the sticker is peeled off.It is definitely not a unicorn or a magical being that appears. It's something much more sinister not suitable for young children.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093375.jpg">

5. The packaging also confirms that "wonderful music" will be played at the touch of a button.In reality, it plays a cackling laugh and lights up when turned on.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093376.jpg">

6. Allen is shocked that this would ever be sold in any store."I'm outraged. I want to know how they think that that is suitable for a child," asks Allen.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093377.jpg">

7. Whoever peels the sticker is shown a disturbing photo. A young girl is seen smiling diabolically with long fangs and blood dripping from her mouth. Her eyes are blurred white and red, making her appear possessed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093378.gif">

8. The most disturbing and terrifying part of the photo is what the girl is doing to herself.In the photo, the girl is using a large knife to slit her arms. You can see a large cut and blood.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093379.jpg">

9. Dollar stores across the country continue to sell this "toy." The store owner said it is parents' responsibilities to inspect their children's toy.It is unknown how many stores have lost clients because of their choice to sell this inappropriate gadget. Nonetheless, it serves as a stark reminder to parents that companies will do just about anything to make a buck.

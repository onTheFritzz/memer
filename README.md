1. The voice of South Park’s “Chef,” Isaac Hayes, did not personally quit the show as Stone and Parker had thought. They later found out that his Scientologist assistants resigned on his behalf after Hayes had a stroke, possibly without his knowledge, according to Hayes’ son.

In a 2016 oral history of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Isaac Hayes III confirmed that the decision to leave the show was made by Hayes’ entourage, all of whom were ardent Scientologists. The decision was made after Hayes suffered a stroke leaving him vulnerable to outside influence and unable to make such decisions on his own

5. In 2005, Sony used music CDs to illegally install a rootkit virus on 22 million computers; and when caught, they released an uninstaller that failed to remove the rootkit, installed further programs and illegally collected user information.

Thomas Hesse, president of Sony BMG’s Global Digital Business, went on National Public Radio to say that “most people, I think, don’t even know what a rootkit is, so why should they care about it?”

6. Argos, Odysseus’s dog in the works of Homer. After 20 years of waiting for Odysseus to return home, the dog is the only one to recognize him, he wags his tail and Odysseus sheds a tear, and Argos dies after meeting him one last time. 

Argos was whelped and trained to be the finest hunting dog of his Lord’s estate, and just before he was old enough to go hunting with Odysseus, our hero left on his journey, only returning when Argos was too old to do aught but lift his head in recognition of his master.

10. As we age, we perceive time faster because “adulthood is accompanied by fewer and fewer memorable events” (firsts), our biological clocks slows down along with a few other affecting factors.

This is why you need to take up new things as you get older. Learn how to sail, travel to new places, learn new sports, read new books, meet new people. It’s easy to get into a rut but much more rewarding to continue expanding your life experiences.

12. Mark Whalberg served 45 days for attempted murder after beating a middle-aged Vietnamese man unconscious while calling him “Vietnamese f**king sh*t”. 

By age 13, Wahlberg had developed an addiction to cocaine and other substances. At 15, civil action was filed against him for his involvement in two separate incidents of harassing African-American children (the first were siblings of each other, and the second incident was a group of black school children on a field trip), by throwing rocks and shouting racial epithets. At 16, Wahlberg approached a middle-aged Vietnamese man named Thanh Lam on the street, and using a large wooden stick, knocked him unconscious while calling him a “Vietnam fucking shit”. That same day, Wahlberg also attacked a second Vietnamese man named Hoa “Johnny” Trinh, punching him in the face. He believed he had left his victim permanently blind in one eye. Trinh was interviewed in December 2014 by the Daily Mail; he revealed that he had already lost that eye during the Vietnam War, and did not know the identity of his assailant prior to being contacted by the media. According to court documents regarding these crimes, when Wahlberg was arrested later that night and returned to the scene of the first assault, he stated to police officers: “You don’t have to let him identify me, I’ll tell you now that’s the motherfucker who’s (sic) head I split open.” Investigators also noted that he “made numerous unsolicited racial statements about ‘gooks’ and ‘slant-eyed gooks’.”

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">14 Life Hacks That Will Make Your Life A Whole Lot Easier</a>
1. View your time as an investment, and pay attention to what gives you the greatest return
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495132.png">

2. Don’t ask a veteran if they ever killed someone. It is both the first and worst thing a veteran gets asked about
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495133.jpg">

3. Take pictures of your hair after a good haircut. If you ever need to see a new barber, a picture’s worth a thousand words
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495134.jpg">

4. If you’re buying a used car, make sure to check that the check engine light turns on when you insert the key into the 2nd position and the dash lights up. If not, it likely means they removed the bulb to hide a problem
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495135.jpg">

5. When a stranger asks you to take a photo of a group, take several before and during the “3 2 1” countdown
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495143.jpg">

6. There are still 10,000 puppy mills in the United States. If you’re buying a dog, insist on seeing the breeder’s facilities
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495137.jpg">

7. There’s no such thing as “Just one more time”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495144.jpg">

8. Stop comparing yourself to others. Instead, compare yourself to where you were 1-2 years ago. Whether it’s fitness or finance, use that as motivation for your own goals.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495140.jpg">

9. If you’re ever called by your bank’s fraud department hang up and call them back
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495141.jpg">

10. To avoid the fake, cheesy smile on young kids when you try to take their picture, ask them to tell you a joke while you take it, but tell them that they should absolutely not laugh while telling it. Beautiful pictures every time of glee.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495142.jpg">

11. Use the FORD method when you don’t know what to say in conversation: 

F – Family (Their S/O, kids, siblings, pets, family traditions)
O – Occupation (What do they do? How did they get into it? Where did they go to school?)
R – Recreation (What do they like to do?)
D – Dreams (Ask about their goals, dreams, and aspirations)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495139.jpg">

12. Great idea for pet owners
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495138.jpg">

13. When walking your dogs, make them sit and wait before crossing streets. This will make them hesitate about running into roads if they ever get loose. Works for kids too!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495136.jpg">

14. When you get into a relationship, make a real effort to hang out with friends who invite you to hang out with them

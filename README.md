9. This Roller Coaster Will Literally Kill You.

Here’s how the world’s oddest suicide method would work: First the rider would face a long, slow climb up to more than 500 meters, giving him or her a few minutes to think back on life and contemplate the decision. At the top, there would be time to say a prayer or blow a kiss to relatives (or bail) before pressing the “fall” button and plummeting into the long steep plunge followed by the first 360-degree loop. That’s where most riders would die. According to Urbonas, traveling at 100 meters per second, the person would experience a G-force-induced loss of consciousness due to cerebral hypoxia (lack of oxygen reaching the brain), which often causes a sense of euphoria. Just in case that first one didn’t do it, six more consecutive loops would finish the job. Building the structure would be a challenge. The Euthanasia Coaster would be more than three times the height of the world’s tallest roller coaster, the Kingda Ka, which took 18 months and $25 million to construct.

13. The largest land vehicle ever built: Bagger 293 in Germany.

Deemed the largest land vehicle in history by the Guinness Book of World Records, the Bagger 293 is the single best digging machine man has ever built.
Built in 1995, this bucket wheel excavator is 315 feet tall—dwarfing the Statue of Liberty—738 feet wide and weighs more than 31 million pounds or 15,500 tons. Given all of that size, you’d think it takes a huge crew to run one. But you’d be wrong. Two people run the show.
Its buzz saw-like 70-foot rotating wheel consists of a series of 20 buckets that easily and constantly slice into the earth’s surface, efficiently removing thousands upon thousands of pounds of overburden, the waste soil mining operations need to remove before getting to the coal below.
Once the dirt has been scooped up, it’s transported by the conveyor belt running along the machine’s massive arm to the much smaller dump trucks below that will carry it off.
The Bagger 293 is the largest machine of its kind but has several smaller siblings. The bucket wheel excavator has been around since the 1920s. You can watch two videos of the 293 in action below.

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">8 People Who Got In Trouble Because of Selfies</a>
1. North Carolina resident Natasha Kirkland was excited to be pregnant with baby number four and posted a picture of her growing baby bump on Facebook. Although the image sat in the feed for a couple of days virtually unnoticed, more observant people saw glaring issues which landed her behind bars just three days after sharing the photo.

Evidently, her "haters" online wondered if she was pregnant since she hadn't posted any belly shots yet. Natasha must have been in such a hurry to take a picture and shut her haters down that she dropped everything she was doing before taking the photo, as her drugs and syringes were left in plain sight on a stool in the background. She couldn't claim that the narcotics weren't hers since she also left the elastic tie-off on her upper arm.

Surprisingly, Natasha was only held accountable for some outstanding offenses, including driving with a revoked license, felony credit card fraud, and felony obtaining property under pretenses.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85370606.jpg">

2. The day before his wedding, a United Kingdom man took his last "single" selfie and posted it on Twitter with a sweet message about how scared, yet excited, he was to marry his bride to be, but there was just one problem he took the photo while driving, which is illegal. He outed himself while wearing his sunglasses, which reflected the road ahead of him as he held his phone in one hand and steered with the other. 

An officer stumbled upon the selfie on Twitter and responded with, "Just to keep everyone current on the situation... It is people like this who end up destroying people lives through their own stupidity," referring to the dangers of distracted driving. Please get in touch, and we'll send you your wedding present. $200 fine & 6 points, tweeted the Northumbria Police's official account. 

After being caught red-handed, the driver, who used the handle @Geordie_aviator, deactivated his Twitter account, presumably to keep authorities from actually being able to find and ticket him for his careless stunt.

3. Bragging and going on a spending spree is the last thing any self-respecting thief should do. The alleged mastermind behind an audacious Ocean's Eleven-style airport heist was arrested after posting a selfie with his brand new Lamborghini on social media. 

The kingpin is suspected of being the brains behind a slick raid at South Africa's main international airport which saw an armed gang dressed as police officers seize 15 million in cash as it was loaded on a plane to London. Detectives swooped on the luxury home of the gang's alleged boss after he uploaded pictures of himself and his friends posing with the new $500,000 wheels.

4. On February 2017, a New York woman was arrested for stealing a $13,000 mink coat after posting a photo of herself wearing it on Instagram. 

Angeline Chidowore, 39, worked at the high-end clothing store Moda Operandi and was in charge of inventory. After the coat had gone missing, her boss found pictures of her wearing it on Instagram. She was soon arrested and charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.

5. The arsonist behind California's King Fire in 2014 all but gave himself up to police thanks to a selfie video he took after starting the inferno.

Wayne Allen Huntsman, 39, was given 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to starting the fire, which ravaged 97,717 acres of California forest and 112 buildings over 27 days. And his conviction was inevitable, thanks to his vanity and a quick-thinking good Samaritan.

Huntsman hiked out into the woodlands near King of the Mountain Road in Pollock Pines, El Dorado County on September 13, 2014, and lit two fires blazes he would later claim to investigators were to keep him warm on the record 93-degree day. He then used his cellphone to record a video leaving what appeared to be a last message to his girlfriend, swinging it around to show the smoke rising. "I've got fires all around me. Look at me, babe," he says in the video. "I'm stuck in the middle babe. ... I love you. I always have."
He then fled to a local highway, where a passing retired firefighter, Lars Knutsen, "rescued: him. Huntsman then showed Knutsen the video, and Knutsen recognizing its importance recorded that video on his cell phone.

6. A policeman was caught taking a selfie as a man prepared to jump to his death from a bridge. During the desperate man's final moments, the selfie-obsessed cop is seen posing for a snapshot just feet away.

The man is caught in the background of the policeman's shot, clinging to the bridge in the Turkish capital of Ankara. Just seconds later he leaped almost 600ft to his death, after attempts by other officers to talk him down failed.

The picture of the policeman's heartless selfie sparked fury in Turkey, and he now faces an investigation. The 35-year-old man who jumped from the bridge was later identified as Sadrettin Saskn.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85370611.jpg">

7. A Brooklyn native posted a photo of himself on his Facebook page brandishing a submachine gun he allegedly used in a Michigan bank robbery, and the FBI busted him.

In the picture, Jules Bahler is holding a menacing-looking, long-barreled, assault-style weapon. In the other hand, he is holding a black smartphone, which he uses to take a picture of himself in a bathroom mirror.

Bahler, 21, who calls himself "King Romeo" on his Facebook page, posted the photo in March 2014 with the accompanying caption, "Bought my first house And chopper today, life's great." That same day, according to an FBI affidavit, Bahler entered a Chemical Bank branch in Bay City, brandished a submachine gun and fled with about $7,000. Authorities said Bahler committed two similar crimes in Pontiac, robbing a credit union of $4,300, and a Bank of America branch of $4,000 a few days before.

Before his arrest, a friend tried to warn him about the selfie. U tripping brotha. I wouldn't show that shit off like that, cops be watching this shit brotha.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85370612.jpg">

8. The 2015 Playmate of the Year came under fire in 2016 after she photographed a 70-year-old naked woman without her knowledge in an LA Fitness locker room and posted it on Snapchat with the caption,  If I can't unsee this then you can't either.

Dani Mathers was quickly slammed on social media for body shaming and was banned from all LA Fitness locations. In November, she was charged with a misdemeanor count of invasion of privacy, and sentenced to perform 30 days of community service and three years probation. 

The model, 30, says she has received death threats since the incident went viral last year and has apologized. I never meant to hurt her. I never, ever intended on showing the world this photo. I hope that she could forgive me. I just want her to be able to move on and move forward in her life and not feel judged, or that she what she was doing was being ridiculed, because it had nothing to do with that and I'm so sorry, Mathers said.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">25 Red Flags To Know Before Accepting A Job</a>
1. "Having to take an online IQ test before even being considered for an interview."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225005.jpg">

2. "They try to sell you their service during your interview. It was really really bad."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225012.jpg">

3. "The CEO/boss/whatever drives a conspicuously expensive car."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225007.jpg">

4. "If it's a private/family company, do a Google search for '[company name] defendant' and '[company name] plaintiff.' If the company has been sued, or is in the habit of suing others, that can be a red flag - although sometimes there are legit reasons for either. But it's something worth paying attention to."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225008.jpg">

5. "If the company brings alcohol into the office for 'end of week' sessions on a regular basis. I know they can be fun but it's a stupendously bad idea for all kinds of reasons and if leadership hasn't figured that out then I'd think twice before joining."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225010.jpg">

6. "Open interviews. It tells me that people leave faster than you can bring them in, and with good reason."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225019.jpg">

7. "If when you're visiting the company for the first time and you pass someone in a hallway, do they smile and acknowledge your presence with a nod or maybe a hello, or do they ignore you? It's a small thing but very telling about the workplace culture. Similarly, do people seem 'healthy and energized' or 'grey-faced and tired'?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225011.jpg">

8. "To me it was a, "we will start you low and will give you a ton of money later." They never do. Never happens."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225013.jpg">

9. "If the job description has a nondescriptively massive salary range ($25,000-$100,000).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225015.jpg">

10. "Interviewed with a regional vp of a billion dollar company for a sales role. When I asked if the position was a backfill or open due to growth, he stated a backfill. I asked if the person was promoted or moved to a new role, and his response was, “we have had more people quit in 2021 than ever, and it’s because they can’t handle the pressure.” Needless to say, I declined the next step in the hiring process."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225016.jpg">

11. "I know people (rightfully) like to hate on HR, but if a company brags about "not having an HR department to deal with," expect them to be very disorganized at a minimum."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225017.jpg">

12. "Anything that the manager says in the interview that doesn’t line up with the job description."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225014.jpg">

13. "When you don’t get a review until you ask for a raise. Then, all of a sudden, you work is being questioned and you’re being berated."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225018.jpg">

14. "Trying to rush a decision out of you once the offer is made."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225020.jpg">

15. "I always ask the question, "why is this role open? Is it a new role, or am I replacing someone? Why did that person leave?" This really helps you seeing their reaction and if they look nervous it's because the person who left did it because they were not happy."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225021.jpg">

16. "The “sink or swim” technique. It was my first day as a cashier. I got a couple of hours of training, then I was by myself and we were dead. All of a sudden this rush came in and I was asking for help. The manager goes “sink or swim, we’re busy back here, figure it out.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225022.jpg">

17. "If when you are asked to come in for an interview, you are not treated with total respect for your time. For example, if you find yourself waiting for extended periods for an interview because 'so and so is in a really important meeting.' Similarly, if you are not offered at least water and/or coffee if you're in for several interviews. I once interviewed at a place for seven straight hours with no break, no food, not even a glass of water. Fortunately I wasn't offered the job as it was at Michael Milken's firm... before he went to prison."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225009.jpg">

18. "Are you here just for the money?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225023.jpg">

19. "A couple old senior partners, lots of young employees and nothing in between. That means there’s no opportunity to move up, they can’t get people to stay, and can’t get lateral transfers. They work young folks for as long as they can, and the young folks leave once they figure out the company sucks."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225024.jpg">

20. "When an employee quits or gets fired from the job and the company doesn't hire anyone new to replace them. It can be hard to tell as a red flag at first, but the temporary workload they added to your own, on top of what was left after the person quit, slowly becomes your new permanent workload, without any changes to your pay or benefits to compensate for the additional tasks. The further out it goes without the position being filled, the larger and more obvious the red flag becomes."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225006.jpg">

21. "Everybody is very young in a very old company."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225025.jpg">

22. "Competitive pay," but they wont tell you what the pay actually is in the posting or even the interview."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225026.jpg">

23. "Asking if I planned to have children in the interview. (I was 19.)"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225027.jpg">

24. "Asking if you are somebody who's "willing to put in the time to make sure deadlines are met/work is done," or if you're "the type of person who leaves when the 'workday' is finished?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225028.jpg">

25. "I interviewed once at a very huge organization that had a site in the town I was living in, and these guys were so proud of the new top of the line facilities. When they took me on a tour they pointed out the lovely zen garden area that was made for employees to go “unwind and clear their heads”. The problem with it was this area was positioned directly across from all the higher ups offices. Yeah… no."

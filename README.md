8. After flirting with a woman for half an evening at a party, she came over to me, sat on my lap and whispered in my ear, "so, are we going to your place or my place tonight?" Now, I've always been blessed with a healthy amount of self-confidence; not too much to seem egotistical but just enough to be myself and be content with rejection. That moment rendered me dumbstruck.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224790.jpg">

After what seemed like a full minute, I remember looking up at her and saying, "uhhh, I have roommates. What about you?" She stared me straight in the eyes and said, "we're going to my place tonight. Let's leave soon." It was one of the sexiest, most incredible things a woman has ever said to me. Her self-confidence and decisiveness f*cking scrambled my brains in all the good ways. That was probably 15 years ago and I remember it like it was yesterday. We dated for about 6 months after that and it didn't end up working out, but I'll never forget that first night.

9. Same 3 thoughts in order: This is nice. Am I being pranked? This has gotta be a serial killer.

-u/MoneyMitch93
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224792.png">

10. The ugly truth is it depends on how attractive I find her.
 
-u/bluejester12
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224793.jpg">

11. I’m married to such a woman. And let me tell you there is nothing better than someone saying “let’s skip dessert and go f*ck in the back seat of the van like two teenagers.”
 
-u/Senorpuddin
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224794.jpg">

12. I prefer it. For me, the challenge is finding a woman who is straightforward and has the sexual curiosity to be open to exploration.
 
-u/Financial_Leg1087
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224795.png">

13. If it happens it’s awesome! Sadly, all the action I’ve been getting is women telling me to go f*ck myself.
 
-u/Illustrious_Yeti
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224796.jpg">

14. Depends on my relationship with her. If it’s a S/O then it would be sweet. If it’s a coworker it would be creepy.
 
-u/Hercdajerk35
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224797.png">

15. Directness. I like. Pressure or aggressiveness I don’t like. That’s just me.
 
-u/imregrettingthis
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224798.jpg">

16. If a woman came up to me and said "hey you're hot, you want to have sex with me?" I'd take it as just that, and if I found her attractive enough I'd say yes. Simply her asking me is +3 on the attractiveness score, and I'm not signing up for a marriage, just a bone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224799.png">

I'm not even a huge fan of casual sex but women I would normally not approach, if all they're looking for is to satisfy physical needs and they approach me, I don't see the problem with saying yes. "Do but not date" is a legit category.
 
-u/ichaleynbin
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224800.jpg">

17. All women are straightforward with their sexual desires towards me. They don’t have any. It keeps life incredibly simple.
 
-u/sleepyprojectionist
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224801.png">

18. Kind of just happened to me. Earlier in the week, I was on a date at a local park. We're finished our hike and I walk her to her car. She then asks me if there's anything we can do to keep the date going. I tell her there's a local restaurant, and as I'm telling her this a light bulb goes off in my head. I then say, "we can go back to my place." She had the cutest smile and did a little wiggle/sway and said "OK." It was a fun night.
 
-u/Dogdaydinners
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224802.jpg">

19. The better the communication, the better the sex will be.
 
-u/Pyrrhic_Thoughts
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224803.jpg">

20. If they were straightforward, full stop, I would be over the moon.
 
-u/YouProbablyBoreMe
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87224804.jpg">

21. I wish more knew how to do that. We can't please you if we don't know what you like.

10. Eduard Bloch, the Jewish physician of the Hitler family in his office c. 1938. Bloch was later called a ‘noble Jew’ by Hitler and stood under his personal protection.

This was his family physician growing up. Hitler had siblings, and parents. This doctor did all he could while they were poor, and when Hitler’s mother had cancer. He kindly gave them discounts on medicine, and apparently didn’t charge them when they really needed it. He was supposedly quite fond of the family in general, and when the Holocaust and Nazi rise occurred, Dr Bloch and his wife were protected, and admitted to leave the country without harassment, even allowed to sell their home at a normal price. Dr Bloch really tried to help Hitler’s mother during her illness, and Hitler really appreciated it, even sent the guy flowers at Christmas.
When Dr Bloch wrote to Hitler during the Anschluss, Hitler immediately responded by sending the Gestapo to make sure no harm came to the Blochs.

The siege lasted from September 8, 1941 to January 27, 1944 and was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history, causing considerable devastation to the city of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The total number of human losses during the 29 months of the siege of Leningrad is estimated as 1.5 million, both civilian and military. Only 700,000 people were left alive of a 3.5 million pre-war population. Among them were soldiers, workers, surviving children and women. Of the 700,000 survivors, about 300,000 were soldiers who came from other parts of the country to help in the besieged city.

15. Saigon execution: Murder of a Vietcong by Saigon Police Chief, 1968.

After Nguyen Ngoc Loan raised his sidearm and shot Vietcong operative Nguyen Van Lem in the head he walked over to the reporters and told them that: “These guys kill a lot of our people, and I think Buddha will forgive me”. Captured on NBC TV cameras and by AP photographer Eddie Adams, the picture and film footage flashed around the world and quickly became a symbol of the Vietnam War’s brutality. Eddie Adams’ picture was especially striking, as the moment frozen is one almost at the instant of death. 
For all the image’s political impact, though, the situation wasn’t as black-and-white as it’s rendered. What Adams’ photograph doesn’t reveal is that the man being shot (named Nguyen Van Lem) was the captain of a Vietcong “revenge squad” that had executed dozens of unarmed civilians earlier the same day.

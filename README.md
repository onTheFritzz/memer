## <a href="#link3" id="link2">Mystery Bag Leads Man To Discover Some Else Living In His Apartment</a>
1. So, I just got a new job back in October, working Tech Support on the graveyard shift. I work from 1am - 12pm Friday through Monday's. Needless to say, adjusting my sleep schedule has been quite the task, but I have managed. On the days that I don't work, I still follow my work schedule, waking up at midnight, and staying up until at least 2pm before falling asleep as to keep my sleep schedule in line with my work schedule. I bought blackout curtains to help with this, as trying to sleep with the sun shining is not easy for me, I usually require complete darkness. I live alone, I started noticing weird things happening around my apartment when I would get home from work, or after waking up on my days off. Just little things at first, lights being on, that I swear I turned off, doors being left open or closed.

2. He describes the layout of his apartment, which is important to understand just how creepy the story is. Just so everyone can get a bit of understanding about my apartment: I live on the 2nd floor, and my building is right behind the leasing office. The entrance to my apartment requires you to enter the building first then there is a hallway with 2 apartments on either side, then you can enter the apartment. Each apartment has two deadbolts. One that you can unlock from the outside, and another that requires you to unlock from the inside. There is also a balcony, which faces east, complete with a large, sliding glass door and screen. I use it quite frequently, as I had potted plants out there, but have brought them inside due to the cold weather. My apartment is the one closest to the camera, I intentionally left out the number, for obvious reasons.

3. It turns out the uploader's credit card was stolen. This is where it gets creepy.    Now that they're not here, it had gotten harder to pass off these weird occurrences as my cats. Doors are still being left open and closed, and food has been disappearing from my fridge. At first I passed this off as just me being my usual self and just not remembering that I ate something when I was half asleep or bored. Recently, my boss gave me permission to work from home, as this shift is brand new, as the company is moving to 24/7 support, and the building owner refuses to heat my floor for my shift for only two people. So, I've been doing that for the past couple weeks and last week, I noticed, the metal rod, that acts as a secondary lock on the balcony door, wasn't engaged, so I put it back. I didn't think much of it at the time, as my computer faces my balcony door(I like to people watch and watch the sunrise, sue me) and I sometimes fidget with it with my feet while playing video games. On the 11th of December, my Credit card information was stolen and my account was charged +$3000. I was in the office that day, as a favor to my coworker, who was really creeped out being in the office alone in the middle of the night. The charge was made at 11:40am, just a few moments before I gotten off work, and I had the card on me still. (This is relevant, I promise) I was restless and didn't sleep well. I wake up at midnight, per usual, on Monday morning, and get my set up ready to take calls. Now, almost no calls come in on the weekends, so I'm usually screwing around on Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix.

4. And this is when the creepiness hits insane lengths.    Around 3:00am I was catching up on The 100 when someone unlocked my fucking door! I don't mean, picked the lock, I mean used a key. Thank god the secondary deadbolt was engaged but the person jiggled the door to try and get it to open. I ran and grabbed my gun looked out the peephole but saw nothing. I opened the door, with the intent to shoot someone, but the person was already gone. Before you ask, yes I called the cops, no they didn't find anything. There are no cameras in the hallways of the building, or outside them for that matter, and they told me that there wasn't enough evidence for them to do anything about it, and left. I didn't sleep at all the next night, and decided to stay home, on my days off, to try and catch the person, if they tried to come back. I also asked the leasing office if they handed out any extra keys to my apartment and they said "no." and informed them that I changed the locks on my door. You remember the picture from before? Showing my apartment door? Well the white door, just on the other side of the fire extinguisher, is my storage closet, opened with the same key for the deadbolt. I keep my Christmas tree/Decorations in there and decided it was time to set it up. As i'm pulling out the tree this evening, its only a 5ft tall fake tree that has all the lights attached to it already, I notice a bag, back behind it. A small, black duffel bag, in it, I found a change of clothes, sunglasses, shoes, toiletries and a notebook. What was in the notebook horrified me.
The notebook was packed with notes about the poster. What he found was so chilling he had to call the cops.

5. There were notes about me. What hours/days I worked, notes about my cats, and updated notes that they were no longer there and the date, my fucking credit card number! As I went further and further back in the notes, I found two words, circled multiple times "Balcony Door." Which I assume is how the person entered my apartment for the first time. This creep had been living in my apartment while I've been at work for the past month and I didn't even know it! The worst part is, that I was in my apartment at the same time as this guy, at some point, and didn't even know it. That's the only way he would have gotten my credit card number, and my house key to make a copy somewhere!There are more notes, but I didn't take photo's of them before the police arrived. I was practically in shock and when I saw these notes, I completely shut down. There were notes about when I would leave on my days off, what I brought back, from where (probably based on shopping bags) How long I was gone...this guy stalked me for at least two months... They have found the person responsible for using my Credit Card info, and they're attempting to find her! They're hoping that they will be able to get some information on the guy who gave her my information, as the pants in the photo are in Men's 34/34.

6. For clarification: I did call the cops, they have the bag and everything inside. The only thing is, the guy hasn't come back for the bag, and the thing about fingerprints is that it can take months to a year to get an analysis back if its not "high priority" and to them, they have homicides to deal with, so Home Invasion is kind of bottom of the ladder. They pulled the security footage from the leasing office, but nothing was found. They are going to try to get CDOT to pull the footage from the Light Rail Station down the road to see if they find anything.

The thief was basically living in this dude's apartment and assumed control of his life while the guy was asleep, all while stealing his identity.

1. Hitler declares war on the United States – December 11, 1941

3. Robert F. Kennedy’s wife, Ethel, attempts to comfort him as lay mortally wounded on floor of the kitchen in the Ambassador Hotel. June 6, 1968.

“We judge the United States of America by [the size of our economy, when that number] . . . does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play; it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.”
-Robert F. Kennedy.

4. American soldier standing in the ruined Monument to the Battle of Nations in Leipzig, Germany, 1945.

A U.S. soldier stands in the middle of rubble in the Monument of the Battle of the Nations in Leipzig after they attacked the city on April 18, 1945. The huge monument commemorating the defeat of Napoleon in 1813 was one of the last strongholds in the city to surrender. One hundred and fifty SS fanatics with ammunition and foodstuffs stored in the structure to last three months dug themselves in and were determined to hold out as long as their supplies. American First Army artillery eventually blasted the SS troops into surrender.

5. Russian Imperial family – circa 1914.

When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George’s first cousin, was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British government offered political asylum to the Tsar and his family, but worsening conditions for the British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George to think that the presence of the Russian royals would be seen as inappropriate. Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was George V who opposed the rescue against the advice of the government. The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were killed by Bolsheviks in 1918. King George V essentially signing his owns cousin’s death certificate.

7. Richard and Mildred Loving. The Supreme Court ruled interracial marriage bans unconstitutional in the case of Loving vs Virginia – June 12, 1967.

The Ruling:
Marriage is one of the “basic civil rights of man,” fundamental to our very existence and survival…. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.

13. While John and Clarence Anglin, 2 of the 3 men who ever escaped from Alcatraz, were officially reported to have drowned in the bay, their mother received flowers anonymously every Mother’s Day until she died, and two very tall unknown women were reported to have attended her funeral.

According to Unsolved Mysteries, a day after the escape a man claiming to be John Anglin had called a lawyer in San Francisco and wanted the lawyer to arrange a meeting with the US Marshals’ Office. When the lawyer refused to do this, the person hung up. The sister of the brothers, Marie Anglin Widner, has told the media she believes that the brothers attented their mother’s funeral in 1973, disguised as women. On October 12, 2015, the History Channel premiered a documentary about the 1962 Alcatraz escape, focusing on John and Clarence Anglin and the possibility that their escape was successful. The program, Alcatraz: Search for the Truth provided viewers with evidence kept by the brothers’ family that included: Christmas cards signed by “John” and “Clarence”; an audio tape of a childhood family friend, Fred Brizzi, telling the family in the early 1990s about a chance encounter in 1975 with the brothers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; a photograph taken by the same family friend in 1975 of two men resembling John and Clarence Anglin.

## <a href="#link1" id="link0">A Day In The Life Of A Porn Movie Shoot</a>
1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376161.jpg">

2. 9 a.m.: The crew starts unloading film equipment at a rented home in the Valley, where most adult content is made for the entire world.

3. Adult performers Briana Banks and Melissa Moore

4. 9:15 am: Two makeup artists (who also work in fashion and mainstream films) work on the actresses. This is Reena Sky, who will be playing the role of "Step-Mother."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376162.jpg">

5. 9:20 a.m.: Briana Banks is getting her hair done. Hair and makeup for adult shoots takes as much time as for any other production — that is, a lot.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376163.jpg">

6. 9:25 a.m.: While the makeup artists work on Reena and Briana, newcomer Melissa Moore waits for her turn in the chair.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376164.jpg">

7. 10 a.m.: The crew has finished placing lights in what's going to be the main set (of several) for this shoot: the bedroom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376165.jpg">

8. 10:30 a.m.: While Melissa is getting her makeup done, director Alan decides to do "Pretty Girls" with Briana. That's is the industry term for glamour stills that are used as slideshows and to promote the videos. Since this is the first time Briana has worked with Girlsway, Alan decides to get her Pretty Girls out of the way.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376166.jpg">

9. 10:45 a.m.: Alan takes Briana to the bedroom to shoot her in a variety of sexy poses.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376167.jpg">

10. 10:45 a.m.: Since this shoot involves MILFs but none of the actresses is married, Alan has brought a variety of prop wedding rings for them to wear as part of their costumes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376168.jpg">

11. 10:45 a.m.: Briana's character is a conservative wife — this was one of the details included in the members' fantasies, to which Girlsway pays close attention.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376169.jpg">

12. 10:50 a.m.: Alan and Briana continue with the Pretty Girls shoot.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376170.jpg">

13. 10:55 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot continues.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376171.jpg">

14. 11 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376173.jpg">

15. 11:05 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376172.jpg">

16. 11:05 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376174.jpg">

17. 11:10 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376175.jpg">

18. 11:30 am: While Alan and Briana are wrapping up the Pretty Girls in the bedroom set upstairs, the makeup artist has started working on 20-year-old Melissa Moore, a fast-rising newcomer starlet in the industry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376176.jpg">

19. 11:45 a.m.: Meanwhile, a crew member is outside interviewing Reena Sky for "extras" that Girlsway includes with its video content. These interviews are identical to the extra material that is shot for mainstream productions for DVD use.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376177.jpg">

20. 12:15 p.m.: Melissa Moore is almost done with her hair and makeup.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376178.jpg">

21. 12:30 pm: Melissa Moore is now made up for camera. She's still wearing her street-clothes. Both Reena Sky and Melissa Moore are Mexican-American, but they don't necessarily play those roles when they're performing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376179.jpg">

22. 12:45 p.m.: Reena is waiting for Alan and the crew to finish setting up cameras and lights. The kitchen of the rented home serves as a center of operations.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376180.jpg">

23. 12:45 p.m.: The production assistant has procured a lot of snacks for the cast and crew. A lot of sugar was consumed on-set, with straight-from-the-box cereal being a popular choice.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376181.jpg">

24. 1 p.m.: Briana has decided on this blue dress to play the conservative nosy neighbor. The actresses brought their own wardrobe for this production, and they offered Alan several choices.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376182.jpg">

25. 1:05 p.m.: Alan begins telling the actresses about the script they are going to shoot, their characters and the specific things they can and cannot say. Since this is a Step-Mother/Step-Daughter fantasy, he is very precise about when the characters should refer to each other as "stepmother" and "stepdaughter" (at first, to establish the relationship) versus "mom" and "daughter" (the rest of the time).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376183.jpg">

26. 1:10 p.m.: Melissa has decided on the Step-Daughter costume.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376184.jpg">

27. 1:15 p.m.: Alan and his director of photography, Craven Moorehead, explain the setups to the actresses. Moorehead is a former adult performer who has transitioned to a behind-the-camera role, and he's being groomed by Alan to begin directing projects for Girlsway.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376185.jpg">

28. 1:20 p.m.: Melissa packs away the alternative choices for her costume
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376186.jpg">

29. 1:30 p.m.: Today's stars: Briana Banks, Melissa Moore and Reena Sky.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376187.jpg">

30. 1:35 p.m.: Alan is splitting duties with Craven. While Alan will shoot some exteriors of Briana as the nosy neighbor snooping around the house, Craven will go with Melissa in her car to shoot the Step-Daughter's arrival at her Step-Mother's house from college.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376188.jpg">

31. 1:50 p.m.: While Craven and Melissa are out shooting the arrival scene, a crew member shoots Briana being interviewed for the extra content.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376189.jpg">

32. 2:10 p.m.: The provisional title for this set of scenes is "The Peeper," as the clapper points out. Jokes about "clapper" and "who's got the clap?" are part of the workplace humor that everyone uses throughout the day to fend off on-set boredom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376190.jpg">

33. 2:!5 p.m.: Reena has decided to wear lingerie and a robe, which would make disrobing easier later in the bedroom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376191.jpg">

34. 2:25 p.m.: Melissa and Reena begin getting comfortable with each other. This will be their first makeout scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376192.jpg">

35. 2:30 p.m.: Melissa and Reena goof around and play with each other before the cameras are ready to roll.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376193.jpg">

36. 2:40 p.m.: Alan gives the actresses some last notes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376194.jpg">

37. 2:50 p.m.: While the crew moves the cameras and lights outside for countershots, Reena takes some selfies for social media. The actresses run their own social media and have to keep posting content for demanding fans.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376195.jpg">

38. 3 p.m.: This is the day's first moment of intimacy being shot on video. Cast and crew have been on set since 9 a.m.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376196.jpg">

39. 3:15 p.m.: Starlet Tiffany Watson has arrived and starts getting in makeup. She will shoot a later scene with Briana. The scene is scheduled for after 5 p.m. but won't start shooting until much later. Briana, who's in all the scenes being shot today, will have an extremely long workday. "And tomorrow morning at 10 I'm doing anal," she tells us. Briana is working extra hard on her comeback to prove to the industry that she's still a bankable star.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376197.jpg">

40. 3:30 p.m. : More problems with the reflections. They're everywhere.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376198.jpg">

41. 3:35 p.m.: Finally, Alan is getting the shot he wanted.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376199.png">

42. 3:45 p.m.: A little break between takes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376200.png">

43. 4 p.m.: Meanwhile, the makeup artist is putting the finishing touches on Tiffany Watson. She will then have to sit around for a couple of hours in full makeup until the previous scene is completed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376201.jpg">

44. 4 .p.m: The makeup artist touches up Reena after her bathroom tryst.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376202.jpg">

45. 4:05 p.m.: Oops — Alan had forgotten to give Reena her "wedding ring." Hopefully this won't distract continuity freaks watching the bathroom scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376203.jpg">

46. 4:05 p.m.: A newly "married" Reena gets her potassium on.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376204.jpg">

47. 4:10 p.m.: Alan shoots a variety of "plot" setups, with the Step-Mother and Step-Daughter miming expressions when found by the disapproving Neighbor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376205.gif">

48. 4:10 p.m.: "Why, I'm shocked at all the lesbianism in this neighborhood..."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376206.gif">

49. 4:15 p.m.: The actresses getting direction
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376207.png">

50. 4:30 p.m.: Alan makes some adjustments.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376208.gif">

51. 4:40 p.m.: OK, time to shoot the sex scene for real. (Reminder: Everyone's been here since 9 a.m.). Melissa puts her costume back on. Everyone rests for a minute. The sex scene will be shot in real time, with no cuts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376209.jpg">

52. 4:45 p.m.: Reena and Melissa begin having sex. Briana is out of the frame, still snooping.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376210.jpg">

53. 4:50 p.m.: Briana comes in and... cut! Alan steps in to remind the actresses that a) they shouldn't say anything that would make the fantasy illegal or inappropriate due to the age of Melissa's character, b) they should talk about "Mom" and "Daughter" without saying "Step" more than necessary, and c) when they turn Briana on to lesbianism, Briana should present some resistance but NEVER say "no" or "stop," which would make the scene rapey. "Oh — I really shouldn't do this! It's so wrong!," on the other hand, is OK.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376211.gif">

54. 4:55 p.m.: "Oh — I really shouldn't do this! It's so wrong!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376212.gif">

55. 5:20 p.m.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376213.jpg">

56. 5:30 p.m.: And it's a wrap!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376214.gif">

57. 5:45 p.m.: Are we punching the clock yet? It's been a long day. Time to hit the shower and go home or go party. Tomorrow? Another day, another scene. That's the way it is in the world capital of adult dreams, the Valley.

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Mystery Bag Leads Man To Discover Some Else Living In His Apartment</a>
1. So, I just got a new job back in October, working Tech Support on the graveyard shift. I work from 1am - 12pm Friday through Monday's. Needless to say, adjusting my sleep schedule has been quite the task, but I have managed. On the days that I don't work, I still follow my work schedule, waking up at midnight, and staying up until at least 2pm before falling asleep as to keep my sleep schedule in line with my work schedule. I bought blackout curtains to help with this, as trying to sleep with the sun shining is not easy for me, I usually require complete darkness. I live alone, I started noticing weird things happening around my apartment when I would get home from work, or after waking up on my days off. Just little things at first, lights being on, that I swear I turned off, doors being left open or closed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85221104.jpg">

2. He describes the layout of his apartment, which is important to understand just how creepy the story is. Just so everyone can get a bit of understanding about my apartment: I live on the 2nd floor, and my building is right behind the leasing office. The entrance to my apartment requires you to enter the building first then there is a hallway with 2 apartments on either side, then you can enter the apartment. Each apartment has two deadbolts. One that you can unlock from the outside, and another that requires you to unlock from the inside. There is also a balcony, which faces east, complete with a large, sliding glass door and screen. I use it quite frequently, as I had potted plants out there, but have brought them inside due to the cold weather. My apartment is the one closest to the camera, I intentionally left out the number, for obvious reasons.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85221105.jpg">

3. It turns out the uploader's credit card was stolen. This is where it gets creepy.    Now that they're not here, it had gotten harder to pass off these weird occurrences as my cats. Doors are still being left open and closed, and food has been disappearing from my fridge. At first I passed this off as just me being my usual self and just not remembering that I ate something when I was half asleep or bored. Recently, my boss gave me permission to work from home, as this shift is brand new, as the company is moving to 24/7 support, and the building owner refuses to heat my floor for my shift for only two people. So, I've been doing that for the past couple weeks and last week, I noticed, the metal rod, that acts as a secondary lock on the balcony door, wasn't engaged, so I put it back. I didn't think much of it at the time, as my computer faces my balcony door(I like to people watch and watch the sunrise, sue me) and I sometimes fidget with it with my feet while playing video games. On the 11th of December, my Credit card information was stolen and my account was charged +$3000. I was in the office that day, as a favor to my coworker, who was really creeped out being in the office alone in the middle of the night. The charge was made at 11:40am, just a few moments before I gotten off work, and I had the card on me still. (This is relevant, I promise) I was restless and didn't sleep well. I wake up at midnight, per usual, on Monday morning, and get my set up ready to take calls. Now, almost no calls come in on the weekends, so I'm usually screwing around on Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85221106.jpg">

4. And this is when the creepiness hits insane lengths.    Around 3:00am I was catching up on The 100 when someone unlocked my fucking door! I don't mean, picked the lock, I mean used a key. Thank god the secondary deadbolt was engaged but the person jiggled the door to try and get it to open. I ran and grabbed my gun looked out the peephole but saw nothing. I opened the door, with the intent to shoot someone, but the person was already gone. Before you ask, yes I called the cops, no they didn't find anything. There are no cameras in the hallways of the building, or outside them for that matter, and they told me that there wasn't enough evidence for them to do anything about it, and left. I didn't sleep at all the next night, and decided to stay home, on my days off, to try and catch the person, if they tried to come back. I also asked the leasing office if they handed out any extra keys to my apartment and they said "no." and informed them that I changed the locks on my door. You remember the picture from before? Showing my apartment door? Well the white door, just on the other side of the fire extinguisher, is my storage closet, opened with the same key for the deadbolt. I keep my Christmas tree/Decorations in there and decided it was time to set it up. As i'm pulling out the tree this evening, its only a 5ft tall fake tree that has all the lights attached to it already, I notice a bag, back behind it. A small, black duffel bag, in it, I found a change of clothes, sunglasses, shoes, toiletries and a notebook. What was in the notebook horrified me.
The notebook was packed with notes about the poster. What he found was so chilling he had to call the cops.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85221107.jpg">

5. There were notes about me. What hours/days I worked, notes about my cats, and updated notes that they were no longer there and the date, my fucking credit card number! As I went further and further back in the notes, I found two words, circled multiple times "Balcony Door." Which I assume is how the person entered my apartment for the first time. This creep had been living in my apartment while I've been at work for the past month and I didn't even know it! The worst part is, that I was in my apartment at the same time as this guy, at some point, and didn't even know it. That's the only way he would have gotten my credit card number, and my house key to make a copy somewhere!There are more notes, but I didn't take photo's of them before the police arrived. I was practically in shock and when I saw these notes, I completely shut down. There were notes about when I would leave on my days off, what I brought back, from where (probably based on shopping bags) How long I was gone...this guy stalked me for at least two months... They have found the person responsible for using my Credit Card info, and they're attempting to find her! They're hoping that they will be able to get some information on the guy who gave her my information, as the pants in the photo are in Men's 34/34.

6. For clarification: I did call the cops, they have the bag and everything inside. The only thing is, the guy hasn't come back for the bag, and the thing about fingerprints is that it can take months to a year to get an analysis back if its not "high priority" and to them, they have homicides to deal with, so Home Invasion is kind of bottom of the ladder. They pulled the security footage from the leasing office, but nothing was found. They are going to try to get CDOT to pull the footage from the Light Rail Station down the road to see if they find anything.

The thief was basically living in this dude's apartment and assumed control of his life while the guy was asleep, all while stealing his identity.

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">23 Scariest And Creepiest Creatures Ever Caught On Camera</a>
1. This creepy photo of a Skinwalker went viral in 2014 and left people baffled.
The image was taken by a geologist working in New Mexico. Netizens assumed it was a skinwalker because it shared similar traits to the shapeshifting creature from Native American folklore. Eventually, people assumed it was a prop from the 80s Sci-Fi film "Xtro."But is it really?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362046.jpg">

2. The Fallen Angel Of Catalonia reared its ugly head on June 2016.
Two guys were exploring the Campdevanol Forest in Catalonia, Spain when they spotted this creature with glowing eyes. Some conspiracy theorists claimed there was a video circulated online that proved these guys set everything up, but others aren't quite so sure.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362047.jpg">

3. The tadpole-like creature was scarier than the Loch Ness Monster when it appeared in Australia.
The photo was captured in 1963 by Robert Le Serrec in Queensland. Nobody could identify what species this sea creature was from, but it looked like an extra large black sperm.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362048.jpg">

4. Some accounts claimed that the creature was trying to hunt Le Serrec to eat him.
Eventually, citizens assumed that it was a huge black plastic sheet weighed down by the ocean and not a prehistoric beast.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362049.jpg">

5. The Cooper family's photo went viral when it showed a ghost coming down the roof.
The family had bought a house in Texas in the 50s. When they asked a person to take a photo of them, they were shocked by what they saw after they developed the film. Some netizens claimed that it was the soul of a previous homeowner while others claimed that it was a manipulated image using Photoshop. But it's still creepy AF.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362050.jpg">

6. The Wessex Way Monster was a strange werewolf-like monster that caught everyone's attention.
A CCTV camera captured the unidentified creature by A338 Wessex Way road in Bournemouth, Dorset, England. Many claimed that it was the legendary werewolf of Wessex Way. But others claimed it was a reindeer crossing the northbound side of the road and nothing more.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362051.jpg">

7. Ghosts can be pretty terrifying, especially when they lunge at you from a tree.
Then again, ghosts are sneaky that way. Just ask this freshly married couple from 1942 who unknowingly captured a photo of this ghost lunging towards them in Jasper, Alabama.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362052.jpg">

8. Is this the Great Norwegian Mountain Troll or just a trick of light?
It was taken on December 1942 by the crew of an RAF recon flight 300 miles north of Berge. Whatever it is, we certainly wouldn't want to get caught in that fog alone with this creature.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362053.jpg">

9. Can you see it? Take a closer look on the bottom left hand side by the door.
You'll probably see a mysterious ghostly figure of what looks like a little girl while this woman takes a selfie for her Facebook profile. Now that's an image that's bound to be a lot of likes and a lot of questions.

10. If gates to hell really do exist than this Dover Demon has just been captured on camera.
The image was taken in a small suburb of Boston, Massachusetts by four teens who witnessed the creature at different points in time over a 24-hour period.

11. If you thought school was a drag, be grateful you got out when you did.
At this former old school in St. Augustine, Florida, a haunting figure was seen at the top window, frightening many people looking from down below. Maybe it was just a neat trick to attract tourists, or maybe someone's been in detention for a very, very long time.

12. The ghost of a woman in white has been haunting a Romanian hotel for the past 150 years.
The Decebal Hotel has been around for a while, so it was bound to accrue one or two disgruntled customers over the years. This ghost of a tall woman in a long white frock is believed to haunt the spa area. But it wasn't until 2008 that 33-year-old Victoria Iovan got photographic proof of the ghost.

13. Whoa! Did you see that ghost taking a peak around the corner?
The photo was taken in 2008 by professional photographer Neil Sandbach in Hertfordshire, England. He was there for a wedding project and he wound up taking a photo of this creepy specter among the otherwise beautiful wedding shots.

14. Remember the movie "The Woman In Black"? Well, this might be the real McCoy.
It was taken at a famous haunted house that's over 180 years old in Antioch, TN. You can clearly see that this ghost is wearing an old style black dress, and it isn't camera shy, but you should be ghost shy and get the hell out of there.

15. Could the Jersey Devil have migrated to a forest in Canada?
This is where the footage of the alleged creature was taken, and although the image has been challenged several times, no one has been able to confirm that it's fake. The photo clearly shows what looks like a demon-like creature chasing after a deer. Locals have also refused to go into the woods at night out of fear of running into this supernatural monster.

16. It seems that deer aren't big scaredy cats like us humans when it comes to the supernatural.
Here we see a deer, seemingly unaffected by a strange humanoid figure that appears to be squatting down and laughing or smiling. It was taken in 2012 in northern Pennsylvania, and has defied explanation all these years.

17. Do you believe Bigfoot is real? Want proof? Well, you might have it in this photo.
Many believe this image was taken by a trail cam owner near Thunder Bay, Michigan, and many claim that it's the elusive Bigfoot. Since there have been several reported sightings of the creature in this area, it's very likely, or it could just be some husky logger walking in the distance. Who knows?

18. Do you believe in life on other planets? If so, do you think they live among us?
Well, a man near Berwick, Louisiana claimed that his friend captured this image of an alien in the wreckage of his trail cam. Fortunately, the SIM card wasn't damaged or we'd never have known about this thing's existence. But is it an alien or a hoax?

19. Netizens claim that a Georgia man saw a series of strange lights moving around his property at night.
At first, the man thought someone was trespassing, so he set up trail cams around his property and wound up capturing images of bright glowing things. One of them even looked like it has something protruding from its back and it was also holding a wand like a fairy. But some think it might have been a ghost or an angel.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85362064.jpg">

20. Is this evidence that Bigfoot exists or just a perfectly elaborate hoax?
The simian-like creature from American folklore, who's also known as Sasquatch, has left many people baffled. After centuries of investigation, no one has been able to come up with physical evidence of the creature's existence, but still, this photo of the creature in the Pacific Northwest is difficult to discount.

21. In 1971, farmer Ted Litton caught this weird creature alive in his artificial pond in Lilac, TX.
Eight hours after a local newspaper ran the story, his farm was invaded by Army soldiers wearing decontamination suits. They drained the pond and found nothing, but they did keep the creature that looked like a cross between a scorpion and a crab, and while they promised little 5 grand, they never gave it to him.

22. When you go fishing and catch something, you rarely expect it to talk back to you.
But in 1971, in Hawk's Lake near Clarkson, Minnesota, 16-year-old Jim Hughes caught a huge, ugly fish. Then things got really weird when he unhooked it and the fish said, "Hurts! Hurts!" In a clear, deep voice. Both Jim and his brother Bill heard it and noticed it's man-like hands and fingers and blue eyes. It scared the crap out of them before the creature slid back into the water.

23. In 1999, a man from London noticed an unidentified flying object near his home.
That' when he captured what appeared to be small, ghost-like creatures who were rummaging around behind his fence. The video footage lasted 4 minutes and showed the aliens making barely audible sounds as they looked for who knows what before eventually disappearing. Lucky for him, he wasn't taken onboard the mothership and dissected with an anal probe.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">20 Employees Share Their Most Disgusting Work Stories</a>
1. Part of my last job was coordinating office moves on our campus. My big boss's wife had been working in HR. Her office neighbor decides she wants her office. No problem. She loves her desk and wants to take it in there, so we’ll have to switch the desks around. No problem, me and my guys can knock it out in a few hours.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/20/020521/87291391/boogers.jpg">

I still have my hat on and move the chair and get on my knees with my flashlight and I’m staring into a giant pile of dripping glue, covering every surface I can see under the desk, the bottom, the sides, the drawer return, everything. I’m like why in the f**k would anyone use this much glue to put this desk together, none of my guys would ever be this sloppy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/20/020525/87291392/calf.jpg">

OH MY GOD IT'S BOOGERS! No joke or exaggeration, boogers where covering every surface. Years of accumulation. -browncoat47

2. On many cattle farms when a calf dies at birth it's important to get a replacement calf (usually from a dairy herd or from a cow with twins) so that the cow is regularly sucked (avoiding mastitis) and you don't carry a empty cow for a year.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/20/020538/87291395/coffee.jpg">

My father... took no such chance, a vet and very good surgeon he would skin the dead calf very quickly and stitch it into a little jacket that we would put the new calfs legs through the little sleeves where dead calf's legs had been and with a couple adjustable strands of twine make a perfectly fitting leather jacket for the calf. Then this confused baby animal wearing the still fresh and bloody skin of the dead calf would be brought to the calf-less cow to suckle at the teat. -say-something-nice

3. I found 3 dead bodies at the job I worked after college. The first two were shocking but not surprising. They were old and as they were in a halfway home situation they had had rough lives. One died of heart failure and the other of respiratory arrest.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/20/020550/87291397/diapercheck.jpg">

Both messed me up for a couple days. The 3rd one still gives me nightmares. She had been dead in an un-air-conditioned room for three days. The post mortem contractions curled her into a ball (with her face pointed at the door so when I opened it she was staring at me with no eyes in her sockets.) -Spodson

4. There was a guy fired for spitting in the coffee everyday. Every time he made a pot he would spit into the grinds. Why, you ask? Mind control. He thought if enough people in the office drank coffee with his spit in it, he would be able to control their thoughts, read their minds, etc... -heavymtlbbq

5. Big ticket item was there was a 5 foot hole in the ceiling of the workshop. Every time it rained we would be flooded with at least 2-3 inches of water. I’d be sitting in my office doing typography designs and my chair wheels would be submerged in the water. I had to put my feet on milk crates in order to stay dry. -BanditCT

6. Worked airport security (think the TSA, but not American so only like 50% as awful). Was searching someones bag, as it was believed they had a brick of something in the bag we needed to make sure wasn't... kaboom-y. I opened the bag and looked inside.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/20/020606/87291401/mold.jpg">

The smell, indescribable. As soon as I opened it I got hit with the most foul stench I could imagine, like sewer gas but worse, somehow. I look inside and the bag is full of dirty adult diapers. -Ki11Switch654

7. Different kind of gross, but it's pretty obvious who is in the mascot suit if you're paying attention. Employee walks into closet. Giant Mouse comes out. I'd be doing children's parties and start hearing dads say "Mmm. [Mascot Name] is so hot." "Ooh I want to f**k [Mascot Name]." It was awful. -kw5112

8. Used to work as a dog bather at a grooming facility. Anal glands. Oh, the stench. And if you're not careful, you'll get hit in the face and smell it the rest of the day. Happened to me a couple of times. -wolf_kisses
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/20/020618/87291404/masterbator.jpg">

9. My former boss was just a disgusting person in general. He would chew gum a lot and often he would take it out of his mouth and put it down on his desk to 'Save for later'. We had a laptop in the conference room that was hooked up to the TV, and he rested his wet chewed gum ON THE LAPTOP. -Thoraxe123

10. If I ever see that my old chef is working at a restaurant I'm eating at, I will walk out. I once told him that a big pot of stew that had been left in the fridge had some mold floating on the top. He got a spoon, started stirring it up saying, 'I can't see any mold.' -j-c-s-roberts
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/20/020622/87291405/rat.jpg">

11. Worked a job for a few years cleaning out abandoned houses and apartments to prep them for renovation. So the crew I'm with arrived at a two story home, with only the knowledge that it had a mouse infestation. Upon entering, mice went scattering under (and in some) furniture. There was mouse feces everywhere and on everything. There was old furniture, broken appliances, and left over food in many places.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/20/020627/87291406/spider.jpg">

So much mouse poop we couldn't see the floor underneath at that point. -Version_Red

14. Crawling in a person's crawlspace with a full face respirator (superfund site). Turn from my stomach to my back, and in the process my mask ruptures a spider egg sac. Dozens (millions?) of fetal spiders land on my face. -deleted

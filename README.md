## <a href="#link1" id="link0">Guy Catches Girlfriend Cheating On Him In Their Bed</a>
1. Revenge is a tricky thing. You want to get back at the person who wronged you, but you've gotta do it in the right way...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85337880.jpg">

2. Instead of flipping out and beating the hell out of the guy he found his girlfriend in bed with upon returning home, he decided on a different approach.

3. He snapped these pictures of them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85337881.jpg">

4. Then he posted the pictures on Facebook and waited for them to go viral.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85337882.jpg">

5. He admitted that he initially wanted to "kick the guy's ass," but instead, he "calmly took selfies and walked like a boss. I did tap her to wake her up but she was drunk as a skunk passed out."

Luckily for him, his pictures did indeed go viral, which is a way better punishment than your average beating. People have also been coming out of the woodwork to support Duston in what is clearly a heartbreaking moment in his life. "Good for you on being the bigger person!" one woman commented on his photos, "I'm sure one day you will find someone who thinks the world of you!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/06/23/020908/85389459/replace-1.jpg">

6. He later posted that "I've had thousands of messages, thousands upon thousands of people from all over the world congratulating me on being a better man and walking away."

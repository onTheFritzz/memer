## <a href="#link6" id="link5">22 Fascinating Photos Collected From History</a>
1. Robert McGee, scalped as a child by Sioux Chief Little Turtle in 1864.

Although the custom of “scalping” was once practiced in Europe and Asia, it is generally associated with North American native groups. In scalping, the skin around the crown of the head was cut and removed from the enemy’s skull, usually causing death. In addition to its value as a war trophy, a scalp was often believed to bestow the possessor with the powers of the scalped enemy. In their early wars with Native Americans, European colonists of North America retaliated against hostile native groups by adopting their practice of scalp taking. Bounties were offered for them by colonial authorities, which in turn led to an escalation of intertribal warfare and scalping in North America.

2. Adolf Hitler informs Czech President Emil Hácha of the imminent German invasion of Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939 in Berlin. Hácha suffered a heart attack during the meeting, and had to be kept awake by medical staff, eventually giving in and accepting Hitler’s surrender terms.

In the evening of 14 March 1939, Hitler invited President Hácha to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. Hitler deliberately kept him waiting for hours, while Hitler watched a film. Finally, at 1:30 a.m., on 15 March 1939, Hitler saw the President. He told Hácha that as they were speaking, the German army was about to invade Czechoslovakia. All of Czechoslovakia’s defences were now under German control following the Munich Agreement in September of the previous year. The country was virtually surrounded by Germany on three fronts.
Hitler now gave the President two options: cooperate with Germany, in which case the “entry of German troops would take place in a tolerable manner” and “permit Czechoslovakia a generous life of her own, autonomy and a degree of national freedom…” or face a scenario in which “resistance would be broken by force of arms, using all means.” By four o’clock, after suffering a heart attack induced by Göring’s threat to bomb the capital, Hácha contacted Prague, effectively “signing Czechoslovakia away” to Germany. French Ambassador Robert Coulondre reported that by half past four, Hácha was “in a state of total collapse, and kept going only by means of injections.”

11. The Allied crossing of the St Quentin Canal in 1918. 

The photo shows General J V Campbell on Riqueval Bridge, addressing men of the 46th North Midland Division following their successful assault of the St Quentin Canal on 29th September 1918.
At this point, the canal flowed through a 50 feet deep cutting, the east bank of which, the Germans had fortified with emplaced machine guns, barbed wire and bunkers. It was a strongpoint of the German Hindenburg Line which they considered impregnable. The British decision to attack it was made at the last minute and was intended to divert German attention from another assault taking place further north which involved greener Allied troops.
The morning of the assault was very misty which provided cover to the attacking troops but made it difficult descending to the canal. The Germans, aware of the impending assault, swept the western bank with pre-sighted fire.
Despite this, the assaulting troops used ropes to lower themselves down the bank where they had to cut through barbed wire to reach the canal. Here they used collapsible boats and life preservers to swarm to the other bank before having to attack up a near vertical face in the face of furious German resistances.
At the same time, a company strength, forlorn hope rushed the bridge in the photo. They had to clamber through coils of barbed wire with little cover beyond the bridge parapet. They managed to drive off the German engineers before they were able to fire the explosives already placed along the roadway.
The bridge and bank were both carried and the impregnable Hindenburg Line was breached at this point.

20. The Quartermaster Corps (QMC) of the United States Army begins training dogs for the newly established War Dog Program, or “K-9 Corps.” 1942.

The K-9 Corps initially accepted over 30 breeds of dogs, but the list was soon narrowed to seven: German Shepherds, Belgian sheep dogs, Doberman Pinschers, collies, Siberian Huskies, Malumutes and Eskimo dogs. Members of the K-9 Corps were trained for a total of 8 to 12 weeks. After basic obedience training, they were sent through one of four specialized programs to prepare them for work as sentry dogs, scout or patrol dogs, messenger dogs or mine-detection dogs. In active combat duty, scout dogs proved especially essential by alerting patrols to the approach of the enemy and preventing surprise attacks. – The top canine hero of World War II was Chips, a German Shepherd who served with the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division. Trained as a sentry dog, Chips broke away from his handlers and attacked an enemy machine gun nest in Italy, forcing the entire crew to surrender. The wounded Chips was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star and the Purple Heart–all of which were later revoked due to an Army policy preventing official commendation of animals.

22. Adolf Hitler in 1915, 1916, 1919, 1921.

In 1918 a British soldier allegedly spares the life of an injured Adolf Hitler in World War 1 – Private Henry Tandey, a British soldier serving near the French village of Marcoing, reportedly encounters a wounded German soldier and declines to shoot him, sparing the life of 29-year-old Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler. –
As Tandey later told sources, during the final moments of that battle, as the German troops were in retreat, a wounded German soldier entered Tandey’s line of fire. “I took aim but couldn’t shoot a wounded man,” Tandey remembered, “so I let him go.” The German soldier nodded in thanks, and disappeared. –
Though sources do not exist to prove the exact whereabouts of Adolf Hitler on that day in 1918, an intriguing link emerged to suggest that he was in fact the soldier Tandey spared. A photograph that appeared in London newspapers of Tandey carrying a wounded soldier at Ypres in 1914 was later portrayed on canvas in a painting by the Italian artist Fortunino Matania glorifying the Allied war effort. As the story goes, when British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain traveled to Germany in 1938 to engage Hitler in a last-ditch effort to avoid another war in Europe, he was taken by the führer to his new country retreat in Bavaria. There, Hitler showed Chamberlain his copy of the Matania painting, commenting, “That’s the man who nearly shot me.”

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">12 Of The Strangest Food Heist In History</a>
1. It may come as a surprise, but cheese is one of the most stolen foods in the world. In 2013, an Illinois man by the name of Veniamin Balika stole close to 42,000 pounds of Muenster Cheese, valued at $200,000. He was a big rig driver, who through false paperwork, had his truck filled with the cheese in Wisconsin, then made an attempt to drive to the East Coast, to sell the cheese at a discount to vendors out there on the cheese black market (yep, it exists). He made it as far as New Jersey when he got caught. Wonder if they made him say ‘cheese’ for his mugshot.
The shame of it all was that no one knew if he tampered with the cheese, so it was supposed to be donated to charity, but could have possibly also been destroyed. What a shame.

2. Even Canadians aren’t immune to some high stakes hijinks. Back in 2012, over 6 million pounds of Maple Syrup were missing from the Global Strategic Maple Syrup Reserve warehouse in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec. This is the world largest stockpile of syrup and this became the largest heist in Canadian history, ever! Do you know why? Because the value of that missing syrup was over $18 Million. That’s a lot of loonies!
When the RCMP investigated, they found that the thieves had rented a space within the warehouse and slowly siphoned the syrup from barrels while the guards weren’t looking. When it was all said and done, they arrested over 30 suspects and recovered 2/3rds of the stolen syrup, while the rest was all over pancakes, waffles and chunks of snow everywhere.

3. Not to be left out, there were some wily Italian thieves that ended up walking away with $875,000 worth of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Over the span of 2 years, 11 men scoped out various warehouses and used complex tools, electronics to circumvent alarm systems and even weapons to steal over 2,039 wheels of cheese. In late 2015, they were caught, but it’s uncertain how much of the cheese was recovered.
Imagine how much pasta that could garnish. Cheesus!

4. On New Year’s Eve in 2005, a robber in Moscow broke in to a Red Caviar distributors delivery vehicle and stole $470,000 worth of caviar. As the tradition on New Years in Russia is champagne and caviar at midnight, the loss of over 845 tins of the fish eggs was a huge blow to the affluent partiers in Russia’s capital. The caviar was never seen again.
Guess no one was Russian to kiss at midnight; they were too sad about the caviar.

5. Back in 2013, one of the world most sought after whisky’s was stolen from the distillery. Pappy Van Winkle’s Reserve 20 year goes for thousands of dollars on the secondary market, after a 3 year waiting list. So they were pretty surprised that 65 cases went missing from a protected room in the distillery.
When the finally found the culprits, they discovered only 20 of the cases, plus several cases of other rare whisky’s; only a fraction of the $100,000+ worth of liquor that they had stolen.

6. You’d be surprised, but nuts are a highly stolen and traded commodity on the black market. Back in 2012, 2 dudes stole $300,000 worth of walnuts from an orchard in California. They managed to last a week before getting caught, and the close to 140,000 pounds of nuts were returned back to the orchard.
I’m definitely in the wrong line of work if that’s what nuts are going for.

7. You know how the French love their cheese? Some love it so much, they’ll find an elaborate way to steal it. Just last year, in 2015, thieves stole more than 8,000 pounds of Comté cheese from the Goux-les-Usiers region of France where Comté is produced. No trace was left, even though the heist required cutting through a barbed wire fence and breaking into a building. In case you’re wondering, that’s close to 2 tons of cheese, valued at $43,000.
To this date, the culprits haven’t been found and the cheese (over 100 wheels of it) has most likely been distributed through the black market and is adorning some pretty tasty crackers right about now.

8. Don’t say you wouldn’t be tempted to to this, but in 2013 in Germany, thieves made off with 5 metric tons of Nutella chocolate-hazelnut spread from a parked trailer in the central German town of Bad Hersfeld. 5…Metric…Tons… of Chocolate Hazelnut spread? Hopefully, they stole some toast to go with it.
The loot, valued at over $20,000 wasn’t the first example of things getting stolen in the city of Bad Hersfeld. The previous week, thieves made off with a trailer full of Red Bull.

9. Then, there’s the Smokey and the Bandit styles of highway beer thefts.
In this case, someone went after our other national treasure – Beer! Back in 2004, a truck full of Moosehead Beer was ‘misplaced’ on it’s way to Mexico. The empty truck was later found in a New Brunswick McDonalds parking lot, while the driver was apprehended in Ontario.
The Police began looking for the 60,000 cans of beer, which were easy to distinguish due to the Spanish labels. Cans were found all over New Brunswick; at campgrounds, in various pulled over trucks, at a weed grow op, and they even found some in the forest, empty with bear bite marks in them.

10. Ten years later, down in Orlando, something similar happened. An independent contractor, who’d purchased his truck rig 3 weeks prior, stopped at a truck stop for a drink. In the meantime, his truck full of $32,000 worth of Miller High Life was stolen. Weeks later the truck was found in Miami, with the majority of 44,000 pounds of beer still there.

11. This past June, 2 flatbeds with over $90,000 worth of SweetWater beer went missing, but lucky for them, this is the age of GPS tracking. One hour later, they found 10 pallets of beer stashed in a warehouse near the Atlanta based brewery, and it took a private investigator less than 24 hours to find the remaining 30 pallets of beer.

12. How much soup does one man need? In October of 2013, Eusebio Diaz Acosta, from Florida stole a big rig loaded with $75,000 of Campbell’s soup and started booking it down the highway. 30 miles later, he got caught by police and forced to pull over, where he made a break for it, hopped a fence and started a foot chase.
He got caught. He was charged with 2 counts of Grand Larceny, and the soup was returned to it’s rightful owner. As for the thief, he was in a lot of hot water and given the circumstances, he wasn’t able to afford a “mmm mmm good” lawyer.

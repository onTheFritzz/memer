4. Being a ceremonial guard might seem like a cool job, but standing motionless and expressionless for long hours in every kind of weather is actually not cool at all. Moreover, the guards often have to endure annoying tourists who take pictures with them.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060277.jpg">

22. Unsurprisingly, a gravedigger is one of the least popular jobs, but this profession has been around for centuries, occurring in most cultures. In fact, even some celebrities have worked as gravediggers including former US President Abraham Lincoln and British singer Rod Stewart.

23. One of the dirtiest jobs ever, a renderer engages in rendering, a process that converts animal waste tissue into stable, value-added materials. The smell and sights inside a rendering workplace are a way beyond bearable for most people.

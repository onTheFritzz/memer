## <a href="#link2" id="link1">A Day In The Life Of A Porn Movie Shoot</a>
1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376161.jpg">

2. 9 a.m.: The crew starts unloading film equipment at a rented home in the Valley, where most adult content is made for the entire world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376159.jpg">

3. Adult performers Briana Banks and Melissa Moore
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376160.jpg">

4. 9:15 am: Two makeup artists (who also work in fashion and mainstream films) work on the actresses. This is Reena Sky, who will be playing the role of "Step-Mother."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376162.jpg">

5. 9:20 a.m.: Briana Banks is getting her hair done. Hair and makeup for adult shoots takes as much time as for any other production — that is, a lot.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376163.jpg">

6. 9:25 a.m.: While the makeup artists work on Reena and Briana, newcomer Melissa Moore waits for her turn in the chair.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376164.jpg">

7. 10 a.m.: The crew has finished placing lights in what's going to be the main set (of several) for this shoot: the bedroom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376165.jpg">

8. 10:30 a.m.: While Melissa is getting her makeup done, director Alan decides to do "Pretty Girls" with Briana. That's is the industry term for glamour stills that are used as slideshows and to promote the videos. Since this is the first time Briana has worked with Girlsway, Alan decides to get her Pretty Girls out of the way.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376166.jpg">

9. 10:45 a.m.: Alan takes Briana to the bedroom to shoot her in a variety of sexy poses.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376167.jpg">

10. 10:45 a.m.: Since this shoot involves MILFs but none of the actresses is married, Alan has brought a variety of prop wedding rings for them to wear as part of their costumes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376168.jpg">

11. 10:45 a.m.: Briana's character is a conservative wife — this was one of the details included in the members' fantasies, to which Girlsway pays close attention.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376169.jpg">

12. 10:50 a.m.: Alan and Briana continue with the Pretty Girls shoot.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376170.jpg">

13. 10:55 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot continues.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376171.jpg">

14. 11 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376173.jpg">

15. 11:05 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376172.jpg">

16. 11:05 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376174.jpg">

17. 11:10 a.m.: Briana's Pretty Girls shoot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376175.jpg">

18. 11:30 am: While Alan and Briana are wrapping up the Pretty Girls in the bedroom set upstairs, the makeup artist has started working on 20-year-old Melissa Moore, a fast-rising newcomer starlet in the industry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376176.jpg">

19. 11:45 a.m.: Meanwhile, a crew member is outside interviewing Reena Sky for "extras" that Girlsway includes with its video content. These interviews are identical to the extra material that is shot for mainstream productions for DVD use.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376177.jpg">

20. 12:15 p.m.: Melissa Moore is almost done with her hair and makeup.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376178.jpg">

21. 12:30 pm: Melissa Moore is now made up for camera. She's still wearing her street-clothes. Both Reena Sky and Melissa Moore are Mexican-American, but they don't necessarily play those roles when they're performing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376179.jpg">

22. 12:45 p.m.: Reena is waiting for Alan and the crew to finish setting up cameras and lights. The kitchen of the rented home serves as a center of operations.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376180.jpg">

23. 12:45 p.m.: The production assistant has procured a lot of snacks for the cast and crew. A lot of sugar was consumed on-set, with straight-from-the-box cereal being a popular choice.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376181.jpg">

24. 1 p.m.: Briana has decided on this blue dress to play the conservative nosy neighbor. The actresses brought their own wardrobe for this production, and they offered Alan several choices.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376182.jpg">

25. 1:05 p.m.: Alan begins telling the actresses about the script they are going to shoot, their characters and the specific things they can and cannot say. Since this is a Step-Mother/Step-Daughter fantasy, he is very precise about when the characters should refer to each other as "stepmother" and "stepdaughter" (at first, to establish the relationship) versus "mom" and "daughter" (the rest of the time).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376183.jpg">

26. 1:10 p.m.: Melissa has decided on the Step-Daughter costume.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376184.jpg">

27. 1:15 p.m.: Alan and his director of photography, Craven Moorehead, explain the setups to the actresses. Moorehead is a former adult performer who has transitioned to a behind-the-camera role, and he's being groomed by Alan to begin directing projects for Girlsway.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376185.jpg">

28. 1:20 p.m.: Melissa packs away the alternative choices for her costume
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376186.jpg">

29. 1:30 p.m.: Today's stars: Briana Banks, Melissa Moore and Reena Sky.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376187.jpg">

30. 1:35 p.m.: Alan is splitting duties with Craven. While Alan will shoot some exteriors of Briana as the nosy neighbor snooping around the house, Craven will go with Melissa in her car to shoot the Step-Daughter's arrival at her Step-Mother's house from college.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376188.jpg">

31. 1:50 p.m.: While Craven and Melissa are out shooting the arrival scene, a crew member shoots Briana being interviewed for the extra content.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376189.jpg">

32. 2:10 p.m.: The provisional title for this set of scenes is "The Peeper," as the clapper points out. Jokes about "clapper" and "who's got the clap?" are part of the workplace humor that everyone uses throughout the day to fend off on-set boredom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376190.jpg">

33. 2:!5 p.m.: Reena has decided to wear lingerie and a robe, which would make disrobing easier later in the bedroom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376191.jpg">

34. 2:25 p.m.: Melissa and Reena begin getting comfortable with each other. This will be their first makeout scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376192.jpg">

35. 2:30 p.m.: Melissa and Reena goof around and play with each other before the cameras are ready to roll.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376193.jpg">

36. 2:40 p.m.: Alan gives the actresses some last notes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376194.jpg">

37. 2:50 p.m.: While the crew moves the cameras and lights outside for countershots, Reena takes some selfies for social media. The actresses run their own social media and have to keep posting content for demanding fans.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376195.jpg">

38. 3 p.m.: This is the day's first moment of intimacy being shot on video. Cast and crew have been on set since 9 a.m.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376196.jpg">

39. 3:15 p.m.: Starlet Tiffany Watson has arrived and starts getting in makeup. She will shoot a later scene with Briana. The scene is scheduled for after 5 p.m. but won't start shooting until much later. Briana, who's in all the scenes being shot today, will have an extremely long workday. "And tomorrow morning at 10 I'm doing anal," she tells us. Briana is working extra hard on her comeback to prove to the industry that she's still a bankable star.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376197.jpg">

40. 3:30 p.m. : More problems with the reflections. They're everywhere.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376198.jpg">

41. 3:35 p.m.: Finally, Alan is getting the shot he wanted.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376199.png">

42. 3:45 p.m.: A little break between takes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376200.png">

43. 4 p.m.: Meanwhile, the makeup artist is putting the finishing touches on Tiffany Watson. She will then have to sit around for a couple of hours in full makeup until the previous scene is completed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376201.jpg">

44. 4 .p.m: The makeup artist touches up Reena after her bathroom tryst.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376202.jpg">

45. 4:05 p.m.: Oops — Alan had forgotten to give Reena her "wedding ring." Hopefully this won't distract continuity freaks watching the bathroom scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376203.jpg">

46. 4:05 p.m.: A newly "married" Reena gets her potassium on.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376204.jpg">

47. 4:10 p.m.: Alan shoots a variety of "plot" setups, with the Step-Mother and Step-Daughter miming expressions when found by the disapproving Neighbor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376205.gif">

48. 4:10 p.m.: "Why, I'm shocked at all the lesbianism in this neighborhood..."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376206.gif">

49. 4:15 p.m.: The actresses getting direction
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376207.png">

50. 4:30 p.m.: Alan makes some adjustments.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376208.gif">

51. 4:40 p.m.: OK, time to shoot the sex scene for real. (Reminder: Everyone's been here since 9 a.m.). Melissa puts her costume back on. Everyone rests for a minute. The sex scene will be shot in real time, with no cuts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376209.jpg">

52. 4:45 p.m.: Reena and Melissa begin having sex. Briana is out of the frame, still snooping.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376210.jpg">

53. 4:50 p.m.: Briana comes in and... cut! Alan steps in to remind the actresses that a) they shouldn't say anything that would make the fantasy illegal or inappropriate due to the age of Melissa's character, b) they should talk about "Mom" and "Daughter" without saying "Step" more than necessary, and c) when they turn Briana on to lesbianism, Briana should present some resistance but NEVER say "no" or "stop," which would make the scene rapey. "Oh — I really shouldn't do this! It's so wrong!," on the other hand, is OK.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376211.gif">

54. 4:55 p.m.: "Oh — I really shouldn't do this! It's so wrong!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376212.gif">

55. 5:20 p.m.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376213.jpg">

56. 5:30 p.m.: And it's a wrap!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85376214.gif">

57. 5:45 p.m.: Are we punching the clock yet? It's been a long day. Time to hit the shower and go home or go party. Tomorrow? Another day, another scene. That's the way it is in the world capital of adult dreams, the Valley.

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">You May Not Be Eating What You Think You Eat</a>
1. About 99% of all wasabi sold in the US is fake, reports The Washington Post. The vast majority of wasabi consumed in America is simply a mix of horseradish, hot mustard, and green dye.

True wasabi is difficult to grow and extraordinarily expensive, costing $160 a kilogram at wholesale prices. If you're eating real wasabi, you're consuming the stem of a plant, grated and pulverized into a spicy paste. It reportedly has a more complex taste, but needs to be eaten immediately — within 15 minutes, the freshly grated wasabi begins to lose its signature flavor.

2. Lobsters

More than one-third of restaurants, including Red Lobster, swap out lobster for more inexpensive substitutes in their dishes, reports Inside Edition. In February, the news organization ran DNA tests on lobster dishes from 28 restaurants across the country. Thirty-five percent of the samples contained cheaper seafood, such as whiting and langostino.

While langostino means "little lobster" in Spanish, the crustacean is more similar to a hermit crab — and less expensive than American lobsters.

3. Kobe beef

While restaurants across the US offer menu items like the Cheesecake Factory's "Kobe burgers" and pricey "Kobe steaks," the vast majority of these claims are false. Only eight restaurants in the entire US serve real Kobe beef.

Since Kobe beef costs more than $20 an ounce, if you're purchasing something that is supposedly made of Kobe beef and isn't absurdly expensive, you're probably being scammed.

4. Parmesan cheese

In February, Bloomberg News tested store-bought grated cheeses for cellulose, revealing that all of the cheeses — called 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese — tested contained the anti-clumping additive made of wood pulp.

While cellulose is a safe additive, an acceptable level is 2% to 4%, according to cheese technologist Dean Sommer. Cheese makers often mix in higher levels of the wood pulp when making cheese because it is less expensive than pure Parmesan.

5. Red snapper

According to an expert involved in DNA species testing, 94% of the time you order fish labeled red snapper, it is actually a different fish.

A rule of thumb: If the fish is expensive and you haven't seen it displayed whole, there's a good chance it's an imitation. And even then, it's hard to differentiate between wild-caught and farmed fish.

6. Truffles

Real truffles are trendy, prized, and extremely rare. If it's not shaved in front of you, your truffle is likely simply a chemical combination — especially if it's marketed as "truffle oil."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85273721.jpg">

7. Olive oil

Fake versions of olive oil are extraordinarily common, with retailers passing off other seed oils, including soybean oil, peanut oil, and sunflower-seed oil, as the real thing.

Consuming fake olive oil can have serious health consequences, such as a 1981 case in Spain where 20,000 people consumed so-called olive oil that was in fact rapeseed oil, containing a poisonous toxin called aniline.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85273722.jpg">

8. Honey

More than 75% of the honey sold in US grocery stores contains ingredients other than pure honey, reports Food Safety News. Honey is frequently "watered down" and cut with corn or fructose syrup to decrease costs. 

Further, some retailers mislabel certain types of honey as a more expensive and popular types, such as manuka honey, to hike up prices.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">People Share The Weirdest Things They've Seen  Over Someone's Shoulder</a>
1. 50 year old guy sitting on the train in front of me was shamelessly reading One Direction fanfiction. I say 'shamelessly' because it was open full screen on his computer and I'm pretty sure the font was even turned up to be bigger than default.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315616.jpg">

2. I once busted my little brother looking up "naked Pokemon, naked Pikachu" and "big titty black women". It's been almost 20 years. Every few years I'll give him some Pokémon related gift for his birthday with a "never forget" card attached
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315614.jpg">

3. My brother was a voracious user of the old AOL chatrooms. One day out of the blue in conversation with an AOL user from France, he started typing out the french language. I was amazed. Who knew that my brother could converse in french? He never had a french language lesson in his life, never spoke a word in french or any other foreign language, he never cracked open a book on anything, he had no french friends or acquaintances off line, etc. How he knew how to speak in french is a total mystery to me to this day. Never saw him do it again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/04/05/112453/85316381/dsdd.jpg">

4. I found a guy searching for "old granny sex tape" on pornhub, later on I asked him why an old lady and he said:"all we see is youngs or milfs, I needed to change my sight".
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315618.jpg">

5. I saw someone going through the pictures on their phone showing something to someone next to them and needless to say, he forgot he had pictures of him balls deep in a girl (I also somewhat knew) and it scrolled by as he was skimming through the photos.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/04/05/121102/85316442/Phoz.jpg">

6. Some 9th grade kids on my bus really like Hitomi Tanaka
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315622.jpg">

7. Saw one of my 29 year old coworkers looks at my little pony on his computer, wears a my little pony lanyard, has a my little pony sticker on his external hard drive and wears my little pony t-shirts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315620.jpg">

8. looked over a guys shoulder on the bus he was searching through images of blue waffle, the only thing I could describe this guy as is fucked in the head mental shit
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315621.jpg">

9. They were probably suffering from short term amnesia. I sat next to a lady on a bus for a little over an hour. She repeatedly went back to a meme about Valentine's day and laughed at it. She then kept starting to forward it to friends, going back to her Facebook feed and scrolling through all the posts she had just read, arriving at the meme, reading it intently again, laughing, forwarding it to a friend... This went on for 45 minutes
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315615.jpg">

10. Found another furry looking at furry porn in class.Never talked to them.

11. I was on the bus and this guy in front of me was trying to sell 150 editions of Playboy on eBay on his phone. He looked a little sketchy...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315624.jpg">

12. Was on a train once and the guy in front of me was googling "Lois Griffin naked big bum".

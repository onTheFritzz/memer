## <a href="#link5" id="link4">10 Of The Most Paused Scenes In Movie History</a>
1. In ‘Basic Instinct,’ Sharon Stone’s character Catherine Tramell uses her sex appeal to distract the police interrogating her. A simple crossing of her legs leaves all the officers staring and baffled. Boobs or not, you can’t say you didn’t hit pause on that scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177066.jpg">

2. During the pterodactyl attack scene in ‘Jurassic World,’ you may have missed the famous Jimmy Buffett grabbing a few margaritas and running for cover. After this scene his character might not be wastin’ away again in Margaritaville.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177067.jpg">

3. Who doesn’t remember the famous scene in ‘Fast Times at Ridgemont High’ that made the 80’s amazing? In a daydream, Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) pictures Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) getting out of the pool in a red bikini and slowly taking off her top. It may have been a daydream in the film but it was very real for pre-teens everywhere.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177068.jpg">

4. The first ‘Iron Man’ held back on hidden easter eggs, but there’s one that got people excited. Pepper walks in on Tony having the Iron Man suit removed and under Tony’s right arm you can see a prototype of Captain America’s shield sitting on the table.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177069.jpg">

5. Probably one of the most notable movie mishaps happens in ‘Star Wars: A New Hope’ when one clumsy Storm Trooper hits his head walking through a doorway.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177070.gif">

6. With Jones pointing a rocket launcher at Dr. René Belloq (Paul Freeman) in ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,’ it may be hard to notice that a fly lands on Belloq’s face and makes its way into his mouth. The scene was never cut and made it into the finished film.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177071.jpg">

7. It’s no secret that Margot Robbie is a beautifully hypnotic woman. In ‘Wolf of Wall Street,’ she plays Jordan Belfort’s smoke show of a wife, Naomi. In one scene the two get into an argument and Naomi uses her fiery good looks against Jordan. Don’t lie I know you were biting your knuckles too!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177072.jpg">

8. When the fight between Superman and General Zod makes its way to space, they smash into a satellite. You can see the Wayne Enterprises logo plastered on the side, meaning that Batman and Superman existed in the same world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177073.jpg">

9. ‘Fight Club’ was full of little easter eggs here and there but some were too quick to notice without hitting pause. Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) appears for a single frame a few times during the first act. This is your life and it’s ending one minute at a time so don’t miss these quick moments that make ‘Fight Club’ the amazing film it is.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177074.jpg">

10. In ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens,’ Luke Skywalker appears only a single scene in the film. Some people say that Luke is standing next to a gravestone of someone special where others say it’s just an oddly shaped stone.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">Police Are Using Nickelback As Torture Device For Drunk Drivers</a>
1. Police in the small town of Kensington on Canada's Prince Edward Island are subject to more than just a heavy fine or jail time. How's a little Nickelback on your drunken ride to jail sound?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85204949.jpg">

2. The police released a statement saying, "When we catch you, and we will catch you, on top of a hefty fine, a criminal charge and a year's driving suspension we will also provide you with a bonus gift of playing the office's copy of Nickelback in the cruiser on the way to jail . . . "
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85204951.jpg">

3. The police released the statement along with a photo of Nickelback's first album, with the police station pleading, "So please, let's not ruin a perfectly good unopened copy of Nickelback. You don't drink and drive and we won't make you listen to it."

4. 
The Canadian rock band hasn't commented on the punishment yet, but Chad Kroeger talked in 2014 about haters helping the band, saying,"I don't think that all the haters and the critics know how many favors that they've done for us. Because otherwise, we would just be this just whatever band,"

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">18 Crazy Things Found By Hotel Room Service</a>
1. I had a checkout where someone left behind their false teeth. They never came back for them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314053.jpg">

2. I no longer work the job, but when I did I thought I found a dead body because I saw a person in bed under the covers after checkout. I called out but got no response. Guy forgot his inflatable girlfriend under the covers.

3. I remember going into a room and it STANK, soon found the source, 3 dirty nappies floating in a bathtub. That is disgusting but unfortunately not completely abnormal. What was weird was the sight of an untouched large fish from one of the fish&chip shops tucked up in the double bed like a small child. Definitely a memory.

4. Bees and bee crap literally covering every single spot in the place. The guy was a beekeeper and was delivering a hive. He brought it into the room, where the hive tipped over and broke. It took days of scrubbing with some harsh chemicals to get the poo off. Even had to repaint walls.

5. A hole cut in a mattress because the "platinum level" guest s**t the bed drunk and then used a butter knife to cut it out and flip the mattress over.

6. Blood, lots of blood. Literally on everything. Me, and the person cleaning with me, got out of there and reported it. Customer had gotten extremely drunk and sliced his hand open, then freaked. Also found various weapons and one time a raccoon trap. This was my first job, in high school.

7. A giant ring of salt on the carpet like straight out of Supernatural.

8. I worked at a mountain/ski resort the first year it opened. There was a big snowfall in mid-November and suddenly we were fully booked for the Thanksgiving weekend. Management didn't hire any extra cleaning staff, so it took us almost the rest of the next week to work our way through all the rooms and suites. You would not believe how many people had left half-eaten turkey carcasses, not in the refrigerator, or in the trash, but just sitting out on the counter.

9. A pile of human skin, on the floor beside the bed. It was like sunburned skin peelings or something. Truly disgusting.

10. Teams I've been on have found: A dildo stuck to a mirror, butt plug in pull out couch, (poor girl picked it up cause it looked like a ring pop), and used condoms both more than a couple times.

11. This guest left his mom, an elderly disabled woman, in her room for 2 days. She was unclothed, with a colonoscopy bag and catheter bag full to the max. This woman had not eaten in 2 days and could have died if we did not do a life and safety check when the bill was not paid for a 1 nighter. We eventually located her son, who tried to dump her in the hotel so he could go on a bender.

12. A dead elk on a tarp during hunting season.

13. 5 pairs of Yeezys. He traveled alone.

14. We had a guy stay in the hotel who was in town for a competitive eating contest. When he checked out, he s**t all over the bed. Like ALLL over. I think he wiped his a*s with the sheets. We threw everything away.

15. S**t stains on the lampshade. I just spun it around so the stains faced the wall.

16. Broccoli and spinach in the shower on two separate occasions. THREE jars of mustard on the bedside table.

17. Was cleaning a room and opened up the nightstand drawer, and found a fire alarm in a sandwich bag, along with the batteries. It was the one that went with the room, on the ceiling. The ceiling was very tall, it couldn't be reached even by a reasonably tall man standing on the bed, and they had to grab one of the tallest ladders to put it back on. We have no idea how the man reached this, or if he brought in a ladder to do so, nor do we know why. He never spoke to the front desk about it.

18. I used to be a housekeeper back in my youth to pay for college. I'd say for my weirdest was when I saw these three cowboy dudes come out of a room around checkout. I head in to clean it up and there were beer cans and bottles on every available surface but the floor. Weirdest part though, room smelled completely normal and was fairly clean. Not a single indication that the beer was drank there.

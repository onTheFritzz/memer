## <a href="#link2" id="link1">10 Creepypasta Tales To Keep You Up All Night</a>
1. The story goes a little something like this: A Jane Doe is admitted to a hospital in the summer of 1972, and none of the nurses or doctors wish to attend to her because of her horrifyingly smooth mannequin-like appearance. Eventually, one brave doctor gets up the guts  to treat her after she’s been sedated, and she smiles, revealing sharp, pointed teeth. She proceeds to rip out the doctor’s throat and proclaim "I am God" before killing the rest of the staff and disappearing, never to be seen again.

2. Once upon a time in the late 1940s, Russian researchers held an experiment, keeping five political prisoners awake for fifteen days using a gas-based stimulant. Monitoring the subjects through microphones and glass portholes, the scientists left them with enough dry food for thirty days and cots with no bedding. At first, the subjects simply shared their war stories and deep emotional issues as sleep deprivation wore them down. But the subjects would become paranoid and stop communicating with each other. Then, two patients screamed until their vocal cords were shredded. All noise ceased and the researchers became worried. They would open the enclosed room to discover one subject dead and the others in various stages of self-mutilation, begging for the gas to be turned back on. It only gets worse from there.

3. In this story, a teenager heads down to Alabama to visit his extended family. With his cousins and some friends, the group goes camping in the woods and sees a bizarre creature they call "Goatman". It follows them, convulsing and speaking in tongues until it drives the group of teens into a paranoid frenzy. While there’s a ton of variations of this story, the writing of the original always gives me the heebie-jeebies.

4. Hailing from Reddit, this is by far one of my favorite creepypastas. The writer posted two years ago and informed the No Sleep subreddit that his dead girlfriend was communicating with him via social media. The screenshots of the garbled messages felt real enough to give the story some credence. Not only did she keep messaging him from what should have been her inactive Facebook, but she would tag herself in recent pictures of him, in spots where she would have been had she still been alive. Her spirit messages him on Facebook for almost a year until he receives a picture taken from his hallway, peeking into his room. Read the story on Reddit to really get the full effect; even the guy’s comments are downright unnerving.

5. Who doesn’t love a haunted house? In this tale, an friend tells our protagonist, David, about an offer to make $500 if he can survive NoEnd House's nine rooms of torture, and he eagerly accepts. Sh*t basically gets progressively more and more messed up by each room, pushing David to the brink of sanity. The only question I have for David is, "Only $500?"

6. This story comes from another solid Reddit thread. The submitter shares a few stories about his search and rescue experiences in the woods. One involves a young boy who went missing with his sister while they were berry picking with their parents. The sister was found first and revealed that her brother was taken by a "bear man" with a strange face. He was never found. Another story was about a young woman who went hiking with her mother and grandfather. She climbed up a tree to get a better view and never came back down.

7. Have you seen this man? Maybe he’s haunted your dreams. And if you’ve only seen him in your dreams, it would be extremely creepy because, according to science, we only dream of faces we’ve seen in real life. There’s even a website for this guy, where you can commune with other strangers who’ve been visited by him.

8. Remember those niche, often short-lived kids shows from your childhood like Cow and Chicken, Animorphs, or The Pirates of Dark Water? Well, some adults remember a puppet show from the '70s called Candle Cove. Except their memories aren’t filled with laughter and cute songs, but instead marionette characters screaming endlessly at the camera for an entire episode. One viewer would ask his mother about the show, only to find out the true, horrifying nature of the show.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202979.png">

9. Robert the Doll is real, which is already pretty horrifying in and of itself. Supposedly, this doll was given to artist Robert Eugene Otto in the late 1800s by a servant working for the family, which he named after himself. The doll would begin terrorizing the family. Otto kept the doll into adulthood and it drove his late wife to pure insanity. The doll was later found by another family, but the daughter refused to have it in her room. Robert the Doll now chills out in a museum in Florida, and visitors have to politely ask permission before taking a picture of him.

10. According to this story, Disney once poured 30 million dollars into opening a resort in North Carolina called Mowgli’s Palace before suddenly abandoning the project. The narrator of the story searched high and low for records of Mowgli’s Palace, but even the locals to Emerald Isle refused to answer questions about it. Supposedly, our protagonist found the park and photographed various parts of it that were overtaken by nature. He soon discovers the Employees Only section, with evidence that the place had been abandoned in a hurry, as though it were suddenly evacuated. From there, he finds a room marked "CHARACTER PREP 1" and then it all just goes to sh*t.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">10 Of The Most Paused Scenes In Movie History</a>
1. In ‘Basic Instinct,’ Sharon Stone’s character Catherine Tramell uses her sex appeal to distract the police interrogating her. A simple crossing of her legs leaves all the officers staring and baffled. Boobs or not, you can’t say you didn’t hit pause on that scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177066.jpg">

2. During the pterodactyl attack scene in ‘Jurassic World,’ you may have missed the famous Jimmy Buffett grabbing a few margaritas and running for cover. After this scene his character might not be wastin’ away again in Margaritaville.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177067.jpg">

3. Who doesn’t remember the famous scene in ‘Fast Times at Ridgemont High’ that made the 80’s amazing? In a daydream, Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) pictures Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) getting out of the pool in a red bikini and slowly taking off her top. It may have been a daydream in the film but it was very real for pre-teens everywhere.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177068.jpg">

4. The first ‘Iron Man’ held back on hidden easter eggs, but there’s one that got people excited. Pepper walks in on Tony having the Iron Man suit removed and under Tony’s right arm you can see a prototype of Captain America’s shield sitting on the table.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177069.jpg">

5. Probably one of the most notable movie mishaps happens in ‘Star Wars: A New Hope’ when one clumsy Storm Trooper hits his head walking through a doorway.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177070.gif">

6. With Jones pointing a rocket launcher at Dr. René Belloq (Paul Freeman) in ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,’ it may be hard to notice that a fly lands on Belloq’s face and makes its way into his mouth. The scene was never cut and made it into the finished film.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177071.jpg">

7. It’s no secret that Margot Robbie is a beautifully hypnotic woman. In ‘Wolf of Wall Street,’ she plays Jordan Belfort’s smoke show of a wife, Naomi. In one scene the two get into an argument and Naomi uses her fiery good looks against Jordan. Don’t lie I know you were biting your knuckles too!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177072.jpg">

8. When the fight between Superman and General Zod makes its way to space, they smash into a satellite. You can see the Wayne Enterprises logo plastered on the side, meaning that Batman and Superman existed in the same world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177073.jpg">

9. ‘Fight Club’ was full of little easter eggs here and there but some were too quick to notice without hitting pause. Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) appears for a single frame a few times during the first act. This is your life and it’s ending one minute at a time so don’t miss these quick moments that make ‘Fight Club’ the amazing film it is.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177074.jpg">

10. In ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens,’ Luke Skywalker appears only a single scene in the film. Some people say that Luke is standing next to a gravestone of someone special where others say it’s just an oddly shaped stone.

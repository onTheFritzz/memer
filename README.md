## <a href="#link1" id="link0">20 Intriguing Historical Pictures You May Not Have Seen</a>
1. People in Siberia, Russia line up for bread in 1990. This was the norm throughout most of the USSRs history, but people were usually fed post WWII. Unfortunately, as the USSR was collapsing, it got worse and people waited for hours for basic groceries or supplies and wouldn't get what they were in line to get in the first place for days.

2. Indian refugees arrive in London after being expelled from Uganda in 1972. Idi Amin, the former heavyweight boxer turned Ugandan dictator expelled all Asians from the country almost immediately after taking power.

4. The MS St. Louis when it arrived in Antwerp in 1939. This was a German ocean liner carrying around 900 Jewish refugees. The German captain and his crew got them out of Germany. They first tried to seek asylum in Cuba, but were denied. Then they tried the US and Canada, but both denied them as well. Luckily Belgium, The Netherlands, France and the UK accepted them. However, since 3 of those countries were conquered by the Nazi's, over a quarter of these Jews were shipped to camps and died.

9. Students playing a soccer game in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in 1980. China has had space issues for what seems like forever, and this is no different. The field has no room for stands, leaving children dangerously close to watch the game.

10. Jewish children at the Irene Kauffman Settlement school in Pittsburgh in 1934 giving a straight arm salute to the American flag. This salute was much like the Nazi salute, and common in the US before the Nazi's made it their own way of saluting.

Known for their flattering outfits, especially showcasing their legs, CarHop girls were everywhere in the US in the 1940s-1950s. Sometimes they wore roller skates, and had uniforms that made them look like band members (as shown), cheerleaders, or sometimes even only wore bikinis at some locations, or any other absurdly sexy outfit to attract mostly male customers.

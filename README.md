## <a href="#link3" id="link2">21 Fast Food Employees Reveal The Food You Should Never Order</a>
1. If you see something on the menu and can’t find at least one or two other items that the ingredients could be used in, don’t order it.For example, my restaurant has a pulled pork sandwich. We don’t use the pork for anything else. Since it’s not ordered too frequently, it’s not fresh and the product you’re eating might be days or weeks old. It’s not going to get you sick, but it definitely won’t be as fresh as the other things on the menu.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287286.jpg">

2. I used to work at chipotle, and never ever ever order the Tacos. You get less than half the regular portions. Instead, order a bowl with whatever you want in it, then ask for the taco shells, hard or soft, on the side. When I was there, the shells were free to get on the side.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287287.jpg">

3. Tuna sandwiches. 80% mayonnaise.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287288.jpg">

4. I work at a Buffalo Wild Wings. Don’t get anything other than the wings. That’s the only quality thing there. Everything else is frozen shit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287289.jpg">

5. Worked at KFC for ~4 years. The BBQ sandwich is actually made from chicken too old and stale to give to the homeless shelters, so they soak it in BBQ sauce until it can be pulled and then they keep it on the heater for a month.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287290.jpg">

6. I used to work at 7-11, so i’m gonna say any of the taquitos or hotdogs around midnight, up through about 4 or 5AM. around midnight you can be almost assured that these are now high-mileage. That hotdog might have more miles than your car.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287291.jpg">

7. Don’t order the salad. We have to add a butt-load of fatty ranch dressing and fried chicken to cover up the taste of the vile, old iceberg lettuce.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287292.jpg">

8. At our subway, The “oven roasted” chicken was actually boiled in a microwave.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287293.jpg">

9. Jimmy John’s…If you’re trying to order a healthy option, don’t order the Gourmet Veggie Club. It’s the second most caloric sandwich behind something called the “Gargantuan”. 8 slices of provolone cheese will do that.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287294.jpg">

10. Starbucks — don’t order something from the “secret menu”. We sure as shit don’t know what a Snickerdoodle frappuccino is, as it is not a menu item. Employees would be more than happy to make you a drink if you just explain the recipe rather than the name of it. I’ll make you diabetes in a goddamn cup if you just tell me what you want in there. Just don’t get mad at me for not knowing a whole menu customers created.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287295.jpg">

11. Anything egg related after breakfast ends. They keep a very small amount warm after breakfast and it tends to get old fast.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287296.jpg">

12. I used to work at Boston Market. They’re pretty good. The only thing I can think of is that any chicken that isn’t on the bone (sandwich, pot pie, etc) is day old, or more, leftover chicken.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287297.jpg">

13. All Starbucks food is reheated frozen food. Ridiculous how little people realize that. Doesn’t mean it doesn’t taste good, it’s just not fresh at all and incredibly overpriced.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287298.jpg">

14. KFC. Literally anything.The potatoes are powdered potatoes, the gravy is powdered gravy, the corn and green beans come from Green Giant, at least they used to. Now idk where they come from but the green beans taste like shit now.Tenders. Used to be made fresh every order. Now they’re pre battered and stuck in a cooler. Sure, frozen chicken is frozen chicken, and KFC only serves frozen chicken, but when the tenders were fresh with every order and the fryer oil was recently changed, that was peak KFC.Mac and Cheese is microwaved now. Used to be baked. Guess that took too long.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287299.jpg">

15. I’ve worked at 4 restaurants in my life and lemons and ice are by far the most disgusting things you can get” The skin of a lemon contains several thousand pours that can hold bacteria. If the lemons are not carefully washed prior to use, there is a chance that bacterial can make its way into your water.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287300.jpg">

16. I used to work in a baseball park concession stand. The short answer is not to order anything, but if you absolutely have to buy something, don’t buy the hotdogs.Do not. Buy. The Hot Dogs.They made it out of the package okay, and might even have been edible after we finished grilling them – and then they went into the water. We kept three pans of water at the back of the grill that held the hot dogs. Any hot dogs left at the end of the day went back into the fridge, and came out again the next day. Me and the other cook put our feet down on throwing out the water and old hotdogs after two full days, but the management didn’t want to let us.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287301.jpg">

17. I used to work at Wendy’s. The meat used in the chili, yeah that comes from the meat on the grill top that expires and dries up that’s put in to a warming drawer until you have enough for a batch of chili, which we first freeze and then thaw the next day. Also if the chili sitting in the warmer doesn’t sell fast enough we just added hot water to it to mix it up.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287302.jpg">

18. Panera – pasta; it’s all microwaved, this includes Mac and cheese. Smoothies/frozen drinks- nasty base crap that smells and it’s sticky. Cupcakes/coffee cakes- all come frozen. Best items are the real sandwhich/ salads. Real ingredients and usually fresh.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287303.jpg">

19. If you’re really short on time, don’t count on chicken tenders or grilled chicken sandwiches or salads being made quickly at Burger King. I remember that the tenders took forever to cook and we didn’t really make them that often, so most times they were made to order. Same for the grilled chicken.Everything else is whatever, I mean, still shitty because it’s burger King but the normal amount of shitty.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287304.jpg">

20. I work for McDonald's and make sure everyone that matters to me never orders anything that comes out of the ‘McCafe’ machine as these are routinely neglected, in practically all the McDonalds. Not only are staff not properly trained in its cleaning and maintenance, at almost every McDonalds I’ve had experience with, the managers in charge of training them don’t know fuck all either…All McCafe beverages run through a horrifically dirty machine – we’re talking 5+ inches of uncleaned, liquid bullshit making up its inside parts
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287305.jpeg">

21. I worked at taco bell a little bit ago and I warn everyone to stay away from both the beans, and the steak. The beans start out looking like cat food, and the directions are, ‘Add water and stir until you can’t see white anymore.’ The steak was just the worst on dish duty. If it would sit too long it would become like hair gel. It was the worst.

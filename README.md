## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Non-Porn Movies Where The Actors Had Real Sex</a>
1. The Brown Bunny, 2003. This film was notable because it featured a real sex act by a major Hollywood star. Chloë Sevigny’s character performs oral sex on real-life boyfriend Vincent Gallo, which caused an absolute uproar. She later told Playboy that she experienced “a lot of emotions [about the scene]. I’ll probably have to go to therapy at some point.“Film critic Roger Ebert called The Brown Bunny the worst film in the history of Cannes, although after viewing a re-edited version of the film later gave the film his signature “thumbs up.”

2. Love, 2015. Nothing is left to the imagination in director Gaspar Noé’s new film, which is remarkable for being released in 3-D.One reviewer, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, wrote that “There’s a difference between being naked before an audience and showing them your d*ck, and Noé does the latter—very literally, in close-up and 3-D.”

3. Sweet Sweetback’s Badasssss Song, 1971. Decades after the film premiered, star Melvin Van Peebles confessed that not only did he have real sex in the groundbreaking blaxploitation film, he contracted gonorrhea during filming. Yikes!

4. Cruising, 1980. Starring Al Pacino, this film was widely dismissed for being homophobic. The story of a serial killer who targets gay men, “Cruising” features murder scenes that are cut with actual footage of men having sex.The film’s sets were also liberally peppered with phallic symbols: d*cks, d*cks everywhere.

5. Pink Flamingos, 1972. John Waters’ cult classic film broke many boundaries, but one scene in particular is notable for this list’s purposes. Legendary drag queen Divine gives unsimulated oral sex to her son in the film. The actor playing her son wasn’t actually related to her, but the sex act was definitely real. Not for the faint of heart!

6. Romance, 1999. “Romance” is an especially graphic film featuring multiple acts of completely unsimulated sex. Starring Caroline Ducey, the movie received a XXX rating in Canada.An arthouse film, Romance follows the journey of a young woman, Marie, who lives with her boyfriend Paul.Paul refuses any intamacy with her, so Marie searches for it in unusual places. She eventually engages in sadomasochism with an older man, in scenes that were completely unfeigned. The movie contains a (brief) ejaculation shot.

7. All About Anna, 2005. The Danish film All About Anna is billed as a film about sexual relationships, which means it’s chock-full of erotic scenes. In response to public outcry over unsimulated intercourse and masturbation, director Jessica Nilsson defended the film by saying “without the sex scenes, the film’s drama would fall apart.”All About Anna was billed as a romantic comedy for women that just happens to feature plenty of real, unsimulated sex.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85061740.jpg">

8. In the Realm of the Senses, 1976. Based on a true story of insatiable sexual desire, In the Realm of the Senses director Nagisa Oshima created one of the most controversial films of all time. The film also contains many gruesome scenes which were, luckily, re-enactments though all the sex was real.Slate said that “In the Realm of the Senses is a film like no other, a magical fusion of art and pornography that somehow renders debates about the distinction between those two categories boringly beside the point. Asking if this film is porn is like asking if prehistoric cave paintings showing men with erections are porn. They’re porn, they’re art, they’re elemental and beautiful; it doesn’t matter.”

9. Lie with Me, 2005. When audiences commented that the sex between Lauren Lee Smith and Eric Balfour looked very real, everyone on set admitted that it was.Actress Lauren Lee Smith said of the film, “It’s controversial, but it’s also something everyone will understand. It’s about a woman who is not so comfortable with the emotional side of relationships, but is so good with the physical, sexual side. Taking the role wasn’t about the ‘naked chick’ quality – it’s about showing strong, sexual women.”

10. Caligula, 1979. Caligula was based on the real life exploits of the notoriously insane and lustful Roman Emperor and featured plenty of group sex, including penetration, fellatio and ejaculation.The film is called one of the most obscene mainstream movies ever, and IMDb’s Parental Guide states that “No child should ever watch it, and several adults will have trouble with it. The film’s sexual content is considered pornographic in nature, with several hardcore inserts intended to sexually arouse, but really turn out to be quite disturbing.”

13. Baise-moi, 2000. The French title Baise-moi is an ambiguous one.Baiser is a French verb meaning “to f*ck“, but it also means “a kiss” when used as a noun. Baise-moi would be translated as “F*ck me”.Baise-moi, in this film, can be loosely translated to Kiss Me, F*ck Me, or Rape Me, so it’s not surprising that the film is chock-full of graphic, and usually violent, unsimulated sex.

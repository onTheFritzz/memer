## <a href="#link2" id="link1">21 Celebs That People Absolutely Despise</a>
1. Alex Jones, for obvious reasons. -Comet127
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040605/87289276/alexjones.jpg">

2. Chris Brown. A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. (Rihanna) with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040608/87289277/chrisbrown.jpg">

Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle. -Steepanddeep
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040613/87289278/beyonce.jpg">

3. As you know, she named her first child Blue Ivy. There was a Boston-based company that had had that name prior to her naming her child that. She tried to trademark the name, and I think attempted to sue the company; the company won because they had been established for at least a few years at that point.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040614/87289279/dannymasterson.jpg">

Also, when she gave birth, the whole maternity ward was closed off to everyone. Including fathers whose partners had just given birth. Imagine your wife giving birth and you’re not allowed to be there because a celebrity wants the whole floor to herself. -mistressglass
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040622/87289280/ezra.jpg">

4. No one else can't stand Danny Masterson? Rapist protected by a cult? Ruined that show for me, what a POS. -VERO2020
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040626/87289281/jaredfogle.jpg">

5. I just don't understand how Johnny Depp got booted from 'Fantastic Beasts' off of one allegation when Ezra miller has been arrested for things and is just dubious generally and he's still in those movies. -blayndle
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040636/87289283/andydick.jpg">

6. Subway Jared for the depth of his selfishness and depravity. He isn't even a little bit sorry for what he did. -guaukdslkryxsodlnw
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040633/87289282/jeffbezos.jpg">

7. You guys remember that time Andy Dick gave Phil Hartman’s wife, who was in recovery, cocaine? -kitesaredope
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040637/87289284/jennymccarthy.jpg">

8. Jeff Bezos, because he pays his employees garbage wages while he's off going on joy rides to space. -Music_Girl2000
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040638/87289285/jerry.png">

9. Anyone who uses their celebrity platform to promote medical decisions they have no authority or intellect to promote. Jenny McCarthy I am looking at you and all your anti-axxer friends. -Forward-Driver-3676
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040646/87289287/joshduggar.jpg">

10. Jerry Seinfeld.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040649/87289288/kimk.jpg">

I don’t think he’s at all funny, which isn’t why I dislike him. He’s extremely pretentious, seems to think he’s God's gift to comedy. Hes' been very rude in a lot of interviews, especially his with Larry King. Jerry seems like the kind of guy I would hate to meet. -commando_cookie0
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040650/87289289/kanye.jpg">

11. All of the Duggars, but especially Josh for molesting his sisters and cheating on his wife all while espousing wholesome Christian values. He can f**k right off.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040652/87289290/phil.jpg">

Edit: And kiddie p*rn. Massive omission and the biggest offense of them all! I subconsciously tried to forget that one, I guess. -Due-Bed-4669
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040643/87289286/johnlennon.jpg">

12. Kim Kardashian. She’s my pick. Not just because I hate everything she stands for, everything she has generated, everything she has influenced, and the poison she unleashed on a whole generation or two of mainly women, but also because she gets treated as some kind of luminary and hero of something something women.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040659/87289291/lena.png">

She’s constantly the main interview in women power summits, and I’ve so many people filled with pride proclaiming her as “the most powerful business woman in the world” as of that makes her any less of a piece of poisonous shit or her business do anything even remotely constructive to society - in fact it’s just the opposite. Goddam I hate that whole quadrant of American celebrity. -nsinsinsi
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040700/87289292/saltbae.jpg">

13. Kanye West. Literally, he was abusive, practically stalking Kim K and using threatening language and the world just found it entertaining??? Disgusting. -Loveisapill
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040705/87289293/seagal.jpg">

14. Dr. Phil likely knew about abuse going on at a turnaround camp he was sending kids to and then belittled Danielle Bregoli (cash me ousside girl) after she shared her experiences with being at one. -picnic-boy
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040706/87289294/trya.jpg">

15. John Lennon. Look up his personal life, he was actually a POS that preached peace and love but did none of that to his family, friends and kids. -SweetnSour_DimSum
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040710/87289295/tyson.jpg">

16. Lena Dunham. I’m way too lazy to scroll and see if anyone else has mentioned her but if you have, cheers! I cannot abide that sister-molesting, self applauding twat. I hope she rots in obscurity. -Waughwaughwaugh

28. "Toilet With A U-Shaped Divot In The Front"  Answer: It's a type of handicap toilet, more common in Europe than in the US. It's supposed to have an open-front seat, too. That allows a person to slide straight onto and off of the seat (such as from a wheelchair), without their genitals ever touching the seat or the bowl. This is more comfortable and decreases the spread of disease.

## <a href="#link1" id="link0">Movies With The Ultimate WTF Endings</a>
1. Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) - One of the coolest and creepiest sci-fi movies of all time, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a movie where the good guys in no way win. Donald Sutherland's character, a health inspector in San Francisco, is on to the outbreak of weird pod inhabiting creatures that are taking over people's bodies in the city. The final shot is of Sutherland's character walking to work at City Hall when one of the young women he is protecting throughout the film approaches him. He looks at her for a second and then starts pointing for people to seize her, but only admitting from his mouth this awful alien scream. It will give you chills for days.

2. Sleepaway Camp - This is your standard 80s horror flick. There's a camp, horny teens, and a killer, the whole shebang. However it isn't the actual film that stands the test of time, it's only the ending. One of the main characters, Angela, is a teen that was sent to the camp after her brother Peter, died in a horrific boating accident eight years ago, that she can't recover from. After the killer is thought to be caught and dead, the camp counselors head to the lake where they see Angela, nude covered in blood, screaming like an animal with full frontal male genitals. Angela is actual Peter, the brother and Angela died in the crash.

3. Salo or 120 Days of Sodom - Possibly one of the most messed up movies ever made, Salo or 120 Days of Sodom, takes place in Italy during WW2, with four wealth fascist kidnapping 18 teenagers and subjecting them to rape, torture, extreme violence and everything you can think of. The ending of this movie shows one of the fascist looking out over a torture yard with binoculars while the others, cut out the teens tounges, scalp them, poke out their eyes with hot pokers, among many other atrocities. The whole film will make you want to take a shower and you'll think of it for weeks after.

4. The Exorcist - One of the finest horror movies ever made, The Exorcist revamped attendance in the Catholic church like no other movie before or since. The possessed teen Regan is tormented and torments others throughout the film until she ultimately meets Father Merrin, an older priest that has dealt with the Devil in the past. His young, morally-confused assistant, Father Karras, takes on the Devil as it passes through young Regan's body, and throws himself out the window and onto a flight of steep stairs, killing him and ultimately expelling the demon.

5. Requiem For A Dream - This movie is messed up from beginning to end. I mean come on, who could forget the "ass to ass" scene, am I right? This brilliant film into the world of drug use climaxes with the lead character crying in the bed with his arm cut off, his girlfriend on her couch with tears in her eyes clutching her "ass to ass" payment, his best friend sweating on his bunk in prison coming off heroin and his mental patient pill-popping mother in the insane asylum dreaming about hugging her son on a television show. The definition of WTF.

6. Black Christmas (1974) - Set around a group of sorority sisters hang out at their house during the holidays, the bunch is tormented by a killer hiding in the attic that keeps calling them. The film ends with the main character killing her boyfriend, believing he is the killer. The police find the scene and put the young women to bed as she is clearly in shock. The final shot is of the camera pulling back from the bed and heading up the ladder to the attic where you can see the deranged killer, not dead, creepily standing there clutching and knife and whispering.

7. The Mist - A group of strangers hold up in a supermarket after a mysterious mist forms outside of the shop, holding within it terrifying prehistoric monsters. One shopper, the main character David Drayton, and his young son try to keep things calm as they decide an escape plane. The end of the film finds David taking his son, a woman and two elderly shoppers out of the supermarket and driving south. After finding his wife dead at their home and running out of gas he shoots the two elderly people in the back seat, the woman, and his own son. He runs out of bullets and gets out of the car so he will be killed by the monster, only to see the mist lifting and the U.S. Army coming to restore order.

8. A Clockwork Orange - With a film about power violence, rape, and Beethoven, one could only assume it was going to have a WTF ending. The final scene shows our main character Alex Delarge having sex in the snow in front of a group of Dicken's area citizens politely clapping in approval of his fucking. The ending symbolizes Alex turning over a new leaf, becoming a regular citizen while still hanging on to his wild true nature.

9. Fat Girl - One of the most messed up endings in movie history by far, the French film Fat Girl is about a young teen who is overweight and unconfident in the presences of her much more attractive sister. The mother of the two girls at the end of the film finds out about the older more attractive sisters relationship with a man and decides to drive them back to Paris, pulling over half way at a rest stop to sleep. An insane ax murder at the rest stop kills the sister, strangles the mother and rapes the "fat girl" in the woods. The police escort the girl out of the woods the next morning with her promising them nothing happened. The film was banned in Canada until 2003.

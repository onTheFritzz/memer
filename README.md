## <a href="#link8" id="link7">Man Finds Hidden Safe In His Grandparents' House</a>
1. When Redditor evilenglish's grandparents died, he was devastated. He loved spending time with them, and one of his most cherished memories was reading "Treasure Island" with his grandpa, which inspired dreams of finding his own buried treasure.

Their farmhouse in Tennessee was given to him after they passed, and when he went there one day to go through all of their belongings and clean it out, his fantasy of discovering hidden treasure came true.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166122.png">

2. When he opened their closet door, he was greeted with an unpleasant sight. The carpet was dirty and disgusting, so he decided to tear it up and throw it away.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166123.png">

3. That's when he came across this strange slab and realized it was actually a safe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166124.png">

4. After pulling off the metal cap, he found a combination lock. He was really excited to unlock it and see what was inside, but he couldn't figure out the code.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166125.png">

5. He decided it was worth it to hire a locksmith, who had trouble opening it himself because of the limited amount of space he had to work with.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166126.png">

6. But after a lot of effort, the locksmith was able to remove the lock.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166127.png">

7. Then it was finally time to open that bad boy up!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166128.png">

8. At first, he saw what looked like a pile of wet bricks. He remembered that there had been a pipe leak in his grandparents' house a few years ago, and concluded that some water had gotten into the safe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166129.png">

9. The bricks turned out to be a bunch of vintage coin books.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166130.png">

10. The moisture had damaged their covers, but the coins inside were still in pretty good condition.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166131.png">

11. There were so many items packed inside the safe. This is only a third of them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166132.png">

12. His grandma was an avid coin collector, so there were plenty of them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166133.png">

13. Some, like this silver dollar, were in mint condition because of their protective cases.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166134.png">

14. Others were only wrapped in plastic or paper, but they seemed to be fine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166135.png">

15. Unfortunately, the stacks of dollar bills he found weren't as well preserved.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166136.png">

16. Among the piles of money, there were also a few of his grandpa's antique guns and wristwatches.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166137.png">

17. He even came across a few bars of silver.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166138.png">

18. But the best part of his experience was probably discovering that this old toolbox was actually a treasure chest.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166139.png">

19. When he opened it, he was delighted to see that it was chock-full of jewelry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166140.png">

20. What an awesome farewell gift to their grandson!

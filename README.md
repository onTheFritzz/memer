## <a href="#link7" id="link6">12 Paranormal Mysteries Captured on Camera </a>
1. The Falcon Lake incident -In 1967, Stefan Michalak reportedly encountered an unidentified flying object near Falcon Lake, Canada. Michalak was close enough to touch the object but then, it suddenly lifted off, knocking him on his back. Michalak claimed to have been burnt by the object´s exhaust vent that was covered with a grid. The hot gases even left burn marks on his chest as it can be seen in the photo. After this bizarre accident, Michalak got very sick, suffering from symptoms typical of radiation but the nature of the burns has remained a mystery.

2. The extra thumb -One of the most recent photos that have baffled many internet users, this seemingly ordinary photo shows four youngsters posing for the shot. But if you look carefully, you will notice there is what appears to be an extra thumb next to the kid in black on your right. The boys as well the person who took the picture claimed they had no idea whose thumb that was.

3. The Hessdalen lights -Since the 1940’s (possibly earlier) there has been a strange light phenomenon observed in the Hessdalen Valley, Norway. The spectacle has a form of white or yellow light of unknown origin standing or floating above ground level. Between 1981 and 1984, the lights were observed up to 20 times per week but have drastically reduced in frequency since then to about 10–20 times per year. Despite ongoing research and numerous working hypotheses, there is no convincing explanation of the origin of these lights.

4. Hook Island sea monster -In 1964, French photographer Robert Serrec spotted and took a quick picture of what resembled a giant snake-like creature resting on the sea floor off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Some sources claimed it could have been a long tarp or something similar. However, no credible explanation has ever been found for this bizarre photo.

5. Pyramid on the Moon -This image was taken by Apollo 17 in December 1972 during its flight to the Moon near the area known as Geophone Rock. NASA listed this image as “blank”. But after retouching the photo, you can see that is not completely blank. Turning up the contrast, a pyramidal structure can be observed. NASA has never given a credible version of the issue which has led to some speculations about what else can actually be on the Moon, hidden to public awareness.

6. The Solway Firth spaceman -One of the world´s most famous mysterious photos, this image was taken by Jim Templeton near Solway Firth in Cumbria, England in 1964. Behind Templeton´s daughter who was supposed to be the only figure in the picture, there is another entity resembling a spaceman. But Templeton insisted he did not see anyone else present when the photograph was taken. Modern analysis suggested that the figure might have been the photographer’s wife, standing with her back towards the camera, but not even this explanation is convincing enough.

7. The Cooper Family photo -Back in the 1950´s, the Cooper family from Texas moved into their new house. Once there, they took a family photo but when the picture was developed, the image of a body falling from the ceiling was clearly visible. As further investigation on this story has brought no plausible explanation, there exist many speculations; including one that argues that the shadow is the ghost of the previous owner of the house.

8. The Candy Man´s 29th victim? -Dean Corll, later known as the Candy Man, was a serial killer who abducted, raped, tortured and killed 28 young boys between 1970 and 1973. However, in 2012, 40 years after these gruesome crimes, a mysterious photo of a terrified handcuffed boy was found in one of Corll´s accomplice´s possession. As scary as the photo itself was, things got even more agonizing when it was found out that the boy in the photo was not any of the original 28 kids…

9. The Hampton Court ghost -This ghostly figure was captured on a security camera at the Hampton Court, a royal palace located in the Greater London area. The figure appeared to be closing one of the palace´s doors but when the guards arrived at the place, nobody was there. As the palace has a long and violent history, the figure is believed to be one of several ghosts that are rumored to haunt the building.

10. The Freddy Jackson picture -In 1919, Freddy Jackson was accidentally killed by an airplane propeller while working as an air mechanic. Two days later, his squadron took a group photo but when the photo was developed, Freddy Jackson was in the photo. The shocked crew confirmed that the man in the photo was indeed, Jackson. In fact, the picture was taken on the same day as Jackson’s funeral was held. It is believed that Jackson’s spirit was unaware of his death and showed up to have his picture taken as scheduled.

11. The Tulip staircase ghost -Rev. Ralph Hardy, a retired clergyman from White Rock, British Columbia, took this famous photograph in 1966. Originally, he only wanted take a picture of the elegant Tulip Staircase in the Queen’s House section of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England. Upon development, however, the photo revealed a shrouded figure climbing the stairs. Experts who examined the original negative concluded that it had not been tampered with. The vicinity of the staircase is rumored to be haunted and unexplained footsteps have often been heard there.

12. The Worstead church ghost -In 1975, Diane and Peter Berthelot visited the Worstead Church in north Norfolk, U.K. While in the church, Peter took a photo of his wife sitting and praying on one of the church benches but when they developed the film, they found out there was a bizarre ghostly figure sitting right behind Diane. When they got back to the church, a local vicar told them it was the White Lady, the ghost of a healer who was believed to haunt the church.

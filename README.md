## <a href="#link7" id="link6">8 Crazy Experiments From Real Life Mad Scientists</a>
1. Britches :
Britches was a monkey who was torn from his mother and forced into animal testing at the University of California. He was assigned to a project that would test a prototype sonar device for blind people. The only problem is that Britches wasn't blind. The scientists sewed his eyes shut. He was eventually freed by the Animal Liberation Front during a raid in 1985.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126404.jpg">

2. Project MKUltra :
In the 1950s, the CIA's resident scientists began experimenting with mind control, using LSD, electroshock therapy, and the repetition of sound. Most of their findings were destroyed during the Watergate scandal, but there is evidence that the government dosed unsuspecting citizens with drugs to observe them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126405.jpg">

3. Skin Hardening : 
In an effort to make skin tougher for soldiers, Albert Kligman did experiments by using inmates as test subjects. Kligman would inject them with dangerous chemicals, but all his unfortunate test subjects got out of the deal were blisters, burns, and permanent scars.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126406.jpg">

4. The Stanford Prison Experiment :
Subjects were organized into two groups. Some were the "guards" and the others were the "prisoners." Even though they were assigned these roles arbitrarily, the "guards" quickly started displaying sadistic behavior, forcing "prisoners" to strip naked and sleep on the hard concrete. One "prisoner" was dehumanized so much that he had a mental breakdown and was forced to exit the experiment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126407.jpg">

5. The Milgram Obedience Experiment :
Participants in this experiment were told by the experimenter to press a button that would shock another person in the other room. The person being shocked was actually just an actor pretending, but the participant didn't know that. All they were told was that experiment required them to continue shocking this person, upping the voltage until they were motionless. The study found that 65 percent of people would continue shocking the person even after they were screaming in pain. Shocking, right?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126408.jpg">

6. Harlow's Experiments In Isolation :
Rhesus monkeys were torn from their mothers as infants and forced into Harlow's "pit of despair" cage, with only a water bottle to keep them company. The point of the project was to study the effects of isolation on child development and subsequent depression. Not surprisingly, the baby monkeys became depressed. They also developed physical problems like poor digestion. Some even committed suicide by refusing food and water
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126409.jpg">

7. Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment :
The US Public Health Service purposefully injected black male sharecroppers with syphilis in order to study its effects. The effects, of course, were that they would get horrible skin disfigurations and eventually die. It seems the government neglected to treat them after infecting them with the STD. By the way, this went on between 1932 and 1970. That's 40 years! It spanned multiple presidencies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126410.jpg">

8. Criminal Testicle Transplants :
Leo Stanley, head physician of the San Quentin prison in 1913, believed that males who committed crimes had less testosterone than other men, so he would test his theory by giving inmates new testicles. Because of the shortage of human scrotums, sometimes inmates would be fixed with animal balls instead.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">Guy Learns The Hard Way That Putting Your Dick Into A Vacuum Is A BAD Idea</a>
1.

2. “I don’t know if I’m the only one who has ever thought of doing this, but I had this long running fantasy of sticking my dick into the hose of a vacuum cleaner, turning it on, and having it suck me off. One day, when my entire family went to an event leaving me at home, I decided to seize upon this opportunity and try it out. There were several problems to contend with, however.
The first of these problems was the fact that the wet-dry vac I was using(for fear of what jizz would do to the inside of a dry-only vacuum) wasn’t the cleanest thing in the world. Not only that, but the hose head had a slight lip around it that had become almost jagged from scraping away at the floor. What made this even less comfortable is that I didn’t even have any lubricant, so I just tried to use shampoo to reduce friction.
Sliding it in wasn’t very pleasant, but what I had failed to take into consideration was the fact that my dick wasn’t exactly as wide as the vacuum cleaner hose was, so when I turned the thing on, my dick started violently knocking into the inner wall of the hose.
At this point, my windsock of a dick starts to hurt a little bit. Even still, I decide to try a little harder. That is when I realized my ultimate misstep: I had no idea what to do with the hose to get me off. So, I started in the most natural place to start, which, for me, was rubbing it up and down my shaft. Remember that jagged ring around the end of the hose? Well, I didn’t, at least until I start sliding the hose down, at which point I felt as if a million little knives were cutting into my dick, a problem only exacerbated by the lack of lubrication. Any resistance provided by the shampoo was lost to the suction of the vacuum cleaner.”

3. “At this point, I decided that there was truly no point in continuing, because I was in far too much pain to get off. So, I slid the hose off of my dick before turning the machine off. That was my last mistake. I should have turned the thing off first, because when I was sliding my dick out, it rattled even more violently the less that was in there, to the point where the head was getting bounced like a beach ball against the jagged edge of the hose. That was the worst of the pain for sure.
When I finally recovered my dick from the vacuum cleaner, it was beet red. I had gotten properly tenderized. There were parts that had a little skin scraped off which started to scab shortly thereafter. Between the soreness and the scabbing, I was unable to masturbate for a week, and it was mildly painful for the rest of the month.
TL;DR: Stuck my dick into the hose of a vacuum cleaner to try to get off, got tenderized so bad I was unable to masturbate for the better part of a month. But, hey, at least I didn’t get an infection!”

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">8 Crazy Experiments From Real Life Mad Scientists</a>
1. Britches :
Britches was a monkey who was torn from his mother and forced into animal testing at the University of California. He was assigned to a project that would test a prototype sonar device for blind people. The only problem is that Britches wasn't blind. The scientists sewed his eyes shut. He was eventually freed by the Animal Liberation Front during a raid in 1985.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126404.jpg">

2. Project MKUltra :
In the 1950s, the CIA's resident scientists began experimenting with mind control, using LSD, electroshock therapy, and the repetition of sound. Most of their findings were destroyed during the Watergate scandal, but there is evidence that the government dosed unsuspecting citizens with drugs to observe them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126405.jpg">

3. Skin Hardening : 
In an effort to make skin tougher for soldiers, Albert Kligman did experiments by using inmates as test subjects. Kligman would inject them with dangerous chemicals, but all his unfortunate test subjects got out of the deal were blisters, burns, and permanent scars.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126406.jpg">

4. The Stanford Prison Experiment :
Subjects were organized into two groups. Some were the "guards" and the others were the "prisoners." Even though they were assigned these roles arbitrarily, the "guards" quickly started displaying sadistic behavior, forcing "prisoners" to strip naked and sleep on the hard concrete. One "prisoner" was dehumanized so much that he had a mental breakdown and was forced to exit the experiment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126407.jpg">

5. The Milgram Obedience Experiment :
Participants in this experiment were told by the experimenter to press a button that would shock another person in the other room. The person being shocked was actually just an actor pretending, but the participant didn't know that. All they were told was that experiment required them to continue shocking this person, upping the voltage until they were motionless. The study found that 65 percent of people would continue shocking the person even after they were screaming in pain. Shocking, right?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126408.jpg">

6. Harlow's Experiments In Isolation :
Rhesus monkeys were torn from their mothers as infants and forced into Harlow's "pit of despair" cage, with only a water bottle to keep them company. The point of the project was to study the effects of isolation on child development and subsequent depression. Not surprisingly, the baby monkeys became depressed. They also developed physical problems like poor digestion. Some even committed suicide by refusing food and water
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126409.jpg">

7. Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment :
The US Public Health Service purposefully injected black male sharecroppers with syphilis in order to study its effects. The effects, of course, were that they would get horrible skin disfigurations and eventually die. It seems the government neglected to treat them after infecting them with the STD. By the way, this went on between 1932 and 1970. That's 40 years! It spanned multiple presidencies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126410.jpg">

8. Criminal Testicle Transplants :
Leo Stanley, head physician of the San Quentin prison in 1913, believed that males who committed crimes had less testosterone than other men, so he would test his theory by giving inmates new testicles. Because of the shortage of human scrotums, sometimes inmates would be fixed with animal balls instead.

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">14 Conspiracy Theories Proven To Be True</a>
1. You probably grew up hearing this, that breakfast is "the most important meal of the day," but many theorists thought it was a lie, a reverse conspiracy for big companies to sell more breakfast, and turns out... they were right!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233695.jpg">

Well, it turns out that "breakfast is the most important meal of the day" was actually a commercial slogan created by Kellogg's to help sell their new breakfast cereal. The phrase didn't have an ounce of truth—it was just advertising.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233696.jpg">

2. Another one that is, unfortunately, true is that the American government (it is almost always the American), between 1932 and 1972, purposely infected 400 African American men with syphilis. These men were unaware of that and they never gave their consent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233699.jpg">

The study aimed to verify whether sexually transmitted diseases affected black men as they affected white men. When the ominous experiment came to an end, only 74 of the original participants were alive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233697.jpg">

3. Unfortunately for these poor people, this was also true. Since the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) was founded in 1947, several theories about what they actually do started to appear, one of which being that they would have drugged and tortured innocent people in illegal experiments, and as we said, unfortunately, that was true.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233700.jpg">

The experiment was called MKULTRA. Its objective was to learn to manipulate people mentally. The CIA then used several methods, including the secret administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (mainly LSD) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, and several other forms of torture.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233701.jpg">

It took a few years for the theory to go from conspiracy to facts. The operation started in 1953 but was only revealed to the public in 1975, which led the CIA to destroy the documents in order to deny the story. To this day they continue with their experiments, although the American government has always denied them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233702.jpg">

4. I mean, c'mon! Imagine you are walking on the street and out of nowhere, a stranger comes to tell you about how the USA was using children's corpses to do nuclear tests. You would probably laugh in his face and think the guy was crazy, wouldn't you? But, sadly, this is yet another conspiracy that has proved to be true.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233703.jpg">

The government was actually stealing body parts because they needed young human tissue for their tests. They recruited a worldwide network of agents to find recently deceased babies and children and then collect samples and even limbs from them, all without the permission of more than 1,500 grieving families. A mother was not allowed to dress her daughter for her funeral because the doctors had already amputated her legs and did not want her to find out.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233704.jpg">

5. Seriously, who in their right mind would imagine that something so ridiculous was true, especially from Canada? But it was.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233705.jpg">

In the 1950s, the Canadian government created the so-called "fruit machine" to identify who was gay in order to fire them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233706.jpg">

But how did this "gaydar" work? They basically showed images of gay pornography and monitored people's reactions, such as pupil dilation, and if it showed a "gay reaction," it was recorded.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233707.jpg">

6. Today it seems stupid to not know that cigarettes are bad for your health, but back in the 1930s until 1950, all people saw were advertisements saying how good cigarettes were for you, advertisements that came with phrases from legitimate doctors saying "do not worry."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233708.jpg">

For decades, anyone who dared to say that cigarettes were not good, but a poison, were labeled crazy, idiots, or even enemies of the state, since the government made a lot of money with taxes on this product. And when the truth finally came out, what did the companies say? Simple, that they also did not know that cigarettes were harmful to our health.

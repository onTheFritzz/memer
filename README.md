## <a href="#link9" id="link8">18 Celebs Who Were Unfairly Cancelled</a>
1. Fatty Arbuckle. He was a comedian from like the 1930s or 40s that he got accused of r*ping an actress. In truth, she had like an overdose and had a bunch of health problems due to backalley abortions; even though he was proven innocent, his career never recovered from this. -MisterVictor13
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032600/87317537/FattyArbuckle.jpg">

2. The Chicks (formally known as the Dixie Chicks). They never returned to where they were before they called out Bush, and they’re wonderful. -hollyofhyrule
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032550/87317533/chicks.jpg">

3. Al Franken. He got cancelled for posing in a picture like he was honking someone's boobs, no actual touching. And some chick at the State Fair who asked to take a picture with him was freaked out that he put his hand on her waist. -CashPrizesz
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032557/87317535/alfranken.jpg">

4. Eartha Kitt told a president's wife about the unfair reality of POC being pushed to the front lines like fodder and that lead to her basically bring exiled like seriously exiled from the U.S for a very long time. -Trai-Harder
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032559/87317536/eartha.jpg">

5. I’m surprised nobody has said this, but Richard Gere. The man was really popular as an actor until he mentioned the poor treatment of Tibet by the Chinese government. -Lol25Talks
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032610/87317539/gere.jpg">

6. Courtney Love was blacklisted and “cancelled” in Hollywood for publicly warning other female celebrities about Harvey Weinstein in the early 2000s. -Cheri-baby
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032555/87317534/courtneylove.jpg">

7. Aziz Ansari. Here’s my understanding: He went on a date, when then girl went back to his place he asked for a BJ. She said no. He said OK and they watched TV. Then he asked again. She said yes. And that's it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032549/87317532/aziz.jpg">

But he should have been more accepting of her reluctance and she should have stood up for herself sooner. -FYoCouchEddie
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032613/87317540/coreyfeldman.jpg">

8. Corey Feldman literally warned about child abuse in their business and was speaking from experience and was shut down. -kitjen
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032624/87317542/kap.jpg">

9. Colin Kaepernick. Dude was just kneeling to call attention to something he thought was important. -KingBetterBard
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032628/87317543/janet.jpg">

10. Janet Jackson after the Super Bowl. Wardrobe malfunctions happen. -Affectionate-Big-566
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032629/87317544/kathy.jpg">

11. I thought the Kathy Griffin/Trump’s head thing was overblown. -hypo-osmotic
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032636/87317545/jennamarbles.jpg">

12. Jenna Marbles. In all fairness I think she cancelled herself. People went digging and got offended at what they found. She apologized for the fake tan thing, stopped doing YT, and just went on living her best life. -hellokiri
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032651/87317551/sinead.jpg">

13. Sinead O'Conner for ripping up the picture of the pope on Saturday Night live to protest child abuse in the church. -frazing
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032639/87317546/paul.jpg">

14. Paul Reubens. Although he has been somewhat un-cancelled since. -jermleeds
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032643/87317547/monica.jpg">

15. Monica Lewinsky comes to mind. -averyhipopotomus
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032644/87317548/rebeccablack.jpg">

16. Rebecca Black: Puts out bad song on YouTube = death threats. -AquamarineCheetah
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/09/032648/87317549/rachelnichols.jpg">

17. Rachel Nichols, a female sports reporter on a great run on ESPN was spied on from a camera being left on saying that ESPN's policies for minority representation should not supersede her contractual obligated work (hosting the NBA finals.)

11. Sometimes regardless of how good a person you are, how hard you try, and how sincere you feel. There are people who will mistreat and take advantage of you. And more importantly, them doing that usually isn’t your fault. It’s more often a product of who they are and wasn’t as personal or important of a choice for them as it will feel for you.

22. That you need to regularly check and top up the fluids in your car. I bought my first car at 16, a cheap old beater, and knew nothing about cars other than gas makes it go.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">39 'Normal Things' That Some of Us Can't Stand</a>
1. Feeling my own heartbeat
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87285015.jpg">

2. People making Instagram for their babies and making captions as if the baby were writing it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284985.jpg">

3. Dress coding kindergarteners. Who looks at a 5 year old in a tank top and thinks sexual thoughts to the point the 5 year old has to change?!?!?! F*****g gross.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284981.jpg">

4. Tickling that doesn't stop at the victims request.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284982.jpg">

5. Reality tv shows.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284983.jpg">

6. Influencers' toxic positivity on Instagram.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284984.jpg">

7. I’ve had male teachers and staff call me “good girl” after doing a task for them. Apparently this is a way some men say Thankyou to girls. And its f*****g weird and creepy everytime. A simple thanks would suffice.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284986.jpg">

8. When people refer to kids/babies as “flirting” when they are just being playful.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87285010.jpg">

9. When you’re chillin’ with your cat or dog at night with no one else home and they suddenly alert and look super-alarmed like they heard something.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284987.jpg">

10. People standing next to or behind you when they can just wait or give you a bit more space. I hate going to airports or any other public line and trying to leave space in front of me and the person behind me just shuffles closer trying to get me to move. Trust me, you pushing me to move forwards isn’t going to make the line move any faster. It just makes it more congested and it’s weird imo
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284988.jpg">

11. Telling young girls to cover up when male family members are visiting. That has never sat right with me
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284980.jpg">

12. People talking about Jesus Christ like they just ran into him at the store.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284990.jpg">

13. When people document (video record or take a photo or write an article) themselves or other people when helping the impoverished, especially those videos of influencers on Youtube vlogging and ‘helping’ the homeless, showing their faces and stuff. BS and creepy for me. If you help, just help, no need to let others know.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284978.jpg">

14. Every company creating an ecosystem requiring my home address and credit card and my birthday just to listen to some music or use some software. Not a shred of my identity is unsold at this point.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284991.jpg">

15. I think it's weird that most couches don't come with washable cushion covers. Everyone finds that normal, but they would think it's weird if someone just slept on a bare mattress without ever putting a sheet on it. When in reality it's exactly the same thing. I bought a couch with cushion covers you can take off and put in the washing machine for that reason.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284992.jpg">

16. Employers rewarding us with 8 hour staff retreat at work where we are expected to share personal info with each other all day. Staff bonding.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284993.jpg">

17. Family channels. Imagine having to live your entire life on camera, with little to no privacy without being able to consent for it. Also to my knowledge there are no current laws that protect child influencers income like child actors have. If your content can’t exist without your child, it’s their job not yours.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284994.jpg">

18. Telling little kids(like 2-10), "aw is that your little girlfriend/boyfriend?". Like a hard stop, no. Creepy and disgusting. No matter the context.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284989.jpg">

19. "what no hug?" When saying goodbye to a person I'd never shown interest in touching
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284995.jpg">

20. The whole "we're all family here" at the workplace. It's like some weird brainwashing to get you to enjoy your job more than you should. Like, no, you're not my family. I'm here to do work and get paid, and that's the only reason I'm here.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87284996.jpg">

21. Asking a couple when they plan on getting pregnant, or a couple’s unsolicited sharing they are trying to get pregnant. I feel gross every time.

29. My dad used to walk with his fingers around the back of my neck when we were in public. He could bever understand why I squirmed away from that and batted his hand away. It just felt like a power thing, it made me feel small and vulnerable. I see it occasionally in public with guys and their girlfriends and dads with their kids and I always get goosebumps from remembering what that feels like.

34. The various poses from Instagram models. It's so cringy it actually creeps me out. Especially when their eyes are slightly squinted and their mouth is half open like it's some sort of seductive sexy thing but it's just way off.

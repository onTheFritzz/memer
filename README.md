## <a href="#link1" id="link0">11 Inventions & Businesses That Proved Haters Wrong</a>
1. Televisions: The long-distance transmission of a moving image was invented in the early 20th century, but television appeared only a few decades later. Why? Because no investors believed in the commercial success of “boxes with live pictures.“ In 1926, inventor Lee de Forest wrote: ”While theoretically and technically television may be feasible, commercially and financially it is an impossibility."

2. Cell phones: The cell phone, based on the idea of honeycombs, was invented by Martin Cooper. People told him that the game wasn’t worth the risk. However, they lined up at the stores on the very first day of sales! This device had a memory of 30 numbers, could work for an hour, and required a 10-hour charge.

3. Emojis: Emojis were created in 1963 by American artist Harvey Ball. He received only $45 for his invention. A few years later, businessmen Bernard and Murray Spain started selling and licensing the yellow "smiles," which brought them more than $50 million.

4. Broken Hearts Bar: Businessmen from the Chinese Nanjiang County created a bar where people going through a breakup could cry without feeling ashamed. When discussing this concept, people said no one needed such a bar. But the "Broken Hearts Bar" quickly became the most popular institution in the city, and its analogs can be found in every country.

5. Supercomputers: When Gaurav Khanna was studying black holes, his laboratory needed an expensive supercomputer. Gaurav had another idea: he bought 412 pretty cheap PlayStation 3 consoles and installed another operating system on them. It turned out to be much more powerful and efficient than its expensive fellow.

6. The Million Dollar Homepage: In 2005, an English student named Alex Tew decided to earn money for his education. He launched a website, each pixel of which cost $1. Anyone could buy a section of the site and post a link to their Web page. In less than 6 months Alex earned more than $1 million.

7. Crazy straws: According to the legend, the creators just wanted to make a child choose the latter between soda and milk. Straws of the most insane shapes and sizes appeared, and they still have immense success among children and adults alike.

8. Hula-Hoop: You can earn a lot by reinventing the wheel. Richard Knerr, inventor of a gymnastics hoop, proved it. Though no one believed in its commercial success, a month after the experiments ended, people lined up to get this round piece of plastic.

9. Surgeon ants: Our ancestors came up with this idea in the first millennium BC. At that time, there were no instruments to sew up wounds, so people used ants, which fastened the edges of wounds with their powerful jaws. Surprisingly, this strange technique was popular until the 7th century.

10. Balls against pollution: The Los Angeles reservoir was at risk of becoming seriously polluted: sunlight in combination with chlorine and bromine could make the water carcinogenic. An unusual decision was made to fill almost the whole reservoir with floating plastic balls. The balls prevented the appearance of algae and the heating of water, which very soon became clean again.

11. Fidget spinners: The most trendy toy of 2017 is, in fact, just an upgraded version of the paper pinwheel. We now have a toy that drives half of humanity crazy. In just a week, a video app dedicated to fidget spinners gathered 7 million subscribers, and the business brings in billions of dollars.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">Girl Makes Pillow Men To Get Revenge On Spying Ex-Boyfriend</a>
1. Today in Things That Have Made International News And We Don’t Know Why, a young lady from the UK got some sweet revenge on her ex-boyfriend. 18-year-old Tiffany Badland had broken up with her boyfriend, over three weeks ago. Yet the spurned lover continued to show up at her house uninvited to spy on her, peering through her windows. Damn, why can’t he just spy on her through Facebook like a normal ex?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148835.jpg">

2. Tiffany told The Sun that her former boyfriend turns into a peeping tom after he’s knocked back a couple brews with the boys. “He goes out every weekend with his friends and gets really drunk and looks through my windows.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148836.jpg">

3. So in order to get revenge on the guy who would routinely be caught peeking through the cracks of her blinds, she concocted a plan. She took pillows and blankets and stuffed them into her ex’s tracksuit he left behind in order to make what she calls “pillow men.” She wanted her ex to think that one of the pillow men was his own brother. And so she and some friends ordered Chinese food one night, and sat on the couch pretending to canoodle with the fake dudes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148837.jpg">

4. While this sounds like a farfetched scheme, sure enough the drunk ex-boyfriend showed up at Tiffany’s house with his bros, and peeked in the window. He was enraged when he saw the girl with her arm around the “man” – even appearing to make out with him. And in some sort of Shakespearean twist the ex-boyfriend did indeed believe it to be his own flesh and blood brother who had betrayed him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148838.jpg">

5. He began banging on the windows and yelling at the girl and her “new lover.” However the prank may have backfired as the ex-boyfriend in still convinced that his brother was actually hooking up with Tiffany and he witnessed the whole thing. This despite the fact she posted the pillow men on social media and revealed the prank. That must have been some dummy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148839.jpg">

6. She posted on Facebook;

“When your ex is a weirdo who spies through your windows with his mates when he’s wrecked to see if you have lads round, so you make some pretend lads just to piss him off. Absolutely howling!!!”

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">Amazing  Transformation That Will Make Your Jaw Drop</a>
1. When Molly Eledge was a 20 years old student she "ate next to nothing", "I was fixated on being skinny" she said.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85050849.jpg">

2. This picture taken at a Halloween part six years ago shows her weighting less than 90lbs and looking like her arms are about to break under the weight of that pumpkin.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85050850.jpg">

3. But after getting help she got healthy and even became a successful athlete. But first things first:
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85050851.jpg">

4. After her sophomore year, in 2009 she was formally diagnosed with anorexia nervosa after her parents got involved.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85050852.png">

5. "My mind had become so warped and focused on food, that I had a hard time enjoying regular life anymore", "I saw a nutritionist and therapist, but I had a hard time listening to what they had to say."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85050853.png">

6. "I was getting so many compliments on looking ‘healthy’ again, but every time I heard that word, I wanted to cry", she said. "Healthy meant fat to me. Even though I no longer looked sickly, my mind was still being controlled by food."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85050854.jpg">

7. Then she found cross fit. Through focusing on improving at CrossFit, setting physical challenges and lifting new weights she started respecting her body and, in 2013, met her fiance, fellow CrossFit athlete Erik, 29.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85050855.jpg">

8. She can now lift 145lbs - more than her own bodyweight, which according to her CrossFit Games athlete profile is 125lbs.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85050856.jpg">

9. What is important is not to be buff or muscular but to be happy with yourself. Anorexia and overeating are both bad and you have to find your path among them to reach a healthy body.

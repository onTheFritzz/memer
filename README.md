## <a href="#link4" id="link3">15 Of The Most Dangerous Gangs In The World </a>
1. Otherwise known as the American Mafia, Cosa Nostra is an extension of the Sicilian Mafia. Highly organized, but extremely violent, Cosa Nostra engages in acts of murder, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and other crimes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166633.png">

2. Los Zetas is one of the most powerful drug organizations on the globe. According to the U.S. government, Los Zetas is “the most technologically advanced, sophisticated, vicious, ruthlessly violent and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166634.png">

3. The Aryan Brotherhood is a white supremacist gang that requires you to kill or assault a fellow prisoner if you want a chance at joining. It’s a gang that you’re in for life- if you try to leave, you either end up in a hospital or in a coffin. The gang is so violent that it is responsible for approximately 1/4 of American prison murders.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166635.png">

4. One of America’s most famous gangs, the Crips are known for wearing blue while carrying out extreme acts of violence. A lot of their casualties actually come from internal conflicts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166637.jpg">

5. Bloods, Just like the Crips, they are known for their violence and flashing their gang colour, which in this case, is red. Originally, they were a faction of the Crips. But when they broke off into their own gang, they had to resort to extreme acts of violence due to the fact that they were outnumbered 3:1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166636.png">

6. 18th Street Gang.These guys are extremely violent. So violent, in fact, that not only is one person assaulted per day on average by an 18th Street gang member in L.A., but their kill count is over 3 times as high as their main rivals.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166638.png">

7. Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC).This gang can be found all throughout the prison systems of Sao Paolo, as well as the favela slums. They use fear to control their territories, and commit crimes such as kidnapping, extortion, and murder. In 2006, the entire city of Sao Paolo was under siege by the gang for nearly a week as the PCC killed police officers and burned down government buildings.

8. Triads.  This Chinese crime syndicate consists of over 2 and a half million members worldwide. Each branch lives by it’s own individual set of customs and rules, but they are all known for their violence and drug trafficking.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166640.png">

9. The Hell’s Angels is probably the most well known biker gang in the world. Police have them classified as one of the “Big Four” bike gangs, and say that they are involved in extortion, prostitution, drug trafficking, and extreme acts of violence.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166641.jpg">

11. When you join the Yakuza, you’re required to cut all ties from your family. Allegiance to the leader is #1 in the Yakuza. Members are usually heavily tattooed, which is why tattoos are sill considered somewhat taboo in Japan.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166643.jpg">

12. The rival of the Hell’s Angel’s, the Mongols are involved in the same activities and are often involved in violent. bloody clashes with them.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166645.jpg">

14. The Russian Mob is known for their involvement in Human trafficking, racketeering, drug trafficking, extortion, murder…the list goes on. These guys are not afraid to kill their own family if they have to.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166646.png">

15. Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13).With over 70,000 members, MS-13 is considered by many to be the most violent gang in the world. They literally do not give a shit who they have to kill in order to instill fear. They’re known for their random acts of violence and even stoop as low as to kill innocent women and children.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Pulitzer Prize Winning Photographs: Part Two</a>
1. 1986:  Tom Gralish – “Philadelphia’s Homeless.”  In winter of 1985 Gralish visited the city’s homeless and encountered Walter.  “I like any kind of food,” said Walter.  Whatever’s there.  Hotdog one day, the next Chinese food, roast beef sandwich…”
Walter lives on a sidewalk heating grate and is one of those guys who is hard to reach because he talks to himself and rants to people on the street.  Everyone knows him; people who live and work in the neighborhood give him change.  Eventually, Walter allowed Gralish to photograph him.  “People like it when you pay attention to them.  These guys had disdain for society and the rules, that’s why they objected to the shelters.  They saw themselves as the last free men.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/677914/85345810.jpg">

2. 1987:  David C. Peterson – “American Farmers.”  For photographs depicting the shattered dreams of American farmers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/677914/85345811.jpg">

3. 1988:  Scott Shaw – “Baby Jessica.”  October 14, 1987: Left alone briefly in her aunt’s Midland, Texas, backyard while her mother went inside to answer the phone, 18-month-old Jessica McClure fell into an abandoned 22-foot-deep well.
Firemen, paramedics, and a cadre of drillers struggled to reach her as the town of Midland immediately united for the mission. A fledgling CNN picked up local TV station KMID’s video feed of Baby Jessica’s rescue, and the story became the first live round-the-clock news event, garnering an immense worldwide audience.
Three days into the rescue, paramedic Robert O’Donnell (who was claustrophobic) wriggled down a parallel shaft dug 28 feet down and through a tunnel to come up under Baby Jessica. But her leg, pinned above her head, held  her firmly in place, and O’Donnell couldn’t budge her. Inch by inch, with some patience and K-Y Jelly slathered over the well walls, O’Donnell pulled Jessica free. He handed her to a fireman who wrapped her onto a board and lifted her safely back up into the world, 58 hours after her fall.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/677914/85345812.jpg">

4. 1989:  Ron Olshwanger – “Rescue Attempt.”  Olshwanger captured an image of St Louis firefighter Adam Long giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the limp form of 2 year old Patricia Pettus as he rushed her from a burning apartment on Dec 30, 1988.
The next day, as she clung to life at St. Louis Children's Hospital, the photo ran on the front page of the Post-Dispatch. Before long, it was published in newspapers worldwide, and chronicled a moment that would change fire safety standards around the world.
Six days after the fire, Patricia died. The following spring, Olshwanger was presented the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for spot news photography.
As for Long, the incident branded him a hero — he received a Medal of Honor — though he didn't feel very heroic. "For about a year, I second-guessed myself: 'Did I really do all that I could have done?'" Long said.
The two men grieved when she died. They attended her funeral together.
And as difficult as it was to accept her loss, each found meaning in her death.
"The little girl did not die in vain," said Olshwanger, who said he still receives requests for copies of the photo. "To me, she is a hero because people are going out and buying smoke detectors because of what they see in that photo."
The fire also sparked a friendship between Olshwanger and Long that has remained strong for over 20 years.

8. 1994:  Kevin Carter – “Vulture and Child.”  Carter traveled to Sudan to cover the relentless East African famine.  He found people so weakened by hunger that they were dying at the rate of 20 per hour.
Carter found a young girl trying to make her way to a feeding station and readied his camera.  Suddenly, a vulture landed nearby.  Carter took the photo before chasing the bird away.  Afterward, he sat under a tree and cried.
The picture ran in newspapers worldwide, and Carter received outraged letters and angry phone calls demanding to know why he didn’t pick up the child.  But journalists in Sudan were told not to touch the famine victims because of the risk of disease transmission.  This was no comfort to Carter, who later told a friend, “I’m really, really sorry I didn’t pick the child up.”  The controversy and other personal problems overwhelmed him.  On July 16, 1994, police found Carter dead in an apartment of an apparent suicide.  He was 33 years old.

In September 1994, U.S. Troops landed in Haiti to help return Aristide to power.  In Port-Au-Prince there was a joyous democracy march.  Then someone threw a grenade into the crowd.  People were killed and wounded.  There was shooting, but no one could figure out where it was coming from.  During the chaos, Guzy captured the above image showing a man on the ground with his arm raised.  The crowd thought he had thrown the grenade and were trying to attack him.  Two U.S. Troops were trying to protect him.

Said Rial: “The stream of refuges you see here had been walking for almost 24 hours.  The previous evening they heard word that the Tanzanian government was going to force them to leave.  They were trying to flee, to go deeper into the bush.  They were forced back by the troops into Rwanda.  the group is led by a handful of militia guys.  Men who are the leaders in the communities.  They may or may not be wanted for genocide.”

Elian’s U.S. based relatives lost a bitter legal battle with U.S. officials to prevent Elian from being returned to his father in Cuba.  The Gonzalez family allowed photographer Alan Diaz to wait for the raid with Dalrymple and the boy.

15. 2002:  On the morning of Sep 11, 2001, freelance photographer Steve Ludlum was walking along the Brooklyn waterfront when he saw black smoke pouring from the North Tower of the World Trade Center on the other side of the river.  Ludlum ran home for his camera and found a friend to drive him to the Manhattan Bridge.
Ludlum rested his zoom lens on the iron railing and adjusted his camera.  As he was adjusting the camera, United Airlines Flight 175 was headed toward the South Tower.  He didn’t see the plane hit, but a ball of fire appeared in his viewfinder.  Ludlum released the shutter, thinking all the while it was a bomb.
Ludlum’s usual photo lab was too busy, so he went to a one hour drugstore service.  Ninety minutes later Ludlum went to the New York Times with his film.
The New York Times staff photographers were among the first to arrive at the World Trade Center.  Because communications were disrupted, The Times editors had no way of knowing if their photographers were alive.  After risking their lives to record the destruction of the World Trade Center, they fought through smoke and falling debris to deliver their film to the Times.  Ludlum’s photograph was submitted as part of the Times’ portfolio.

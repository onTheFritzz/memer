## <a href="#link1" id="link0">Man Finds Hidden Safe In His Grandparents' House</a>
1. When Redditor evilenglish's grandparents died, he was devastated. He loved spending time with them, and one of his most cherished memories was reading "Treasure Island" with his grandpa, which inspired dreams of finding his own buried treasure.

Their farmhouse in Tennessee was given to him after they passed, and when he went there one day to go through all of their belongings and clean it out, his fantasy of discovering hidden treasure came true.

2. When he opened their closet door, he was greeted with an unpleasant sight. The carpet was dirty and disgusting, so he decided to tear it up and throw it away.

3. That's when he came across this strange slab and realized it was actually a safe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166124.png">

4. After pulling off the metal cap, he found a combination lock. He was really excited to unlock it and see what was inside, but he couldn't figure out the code.

5. He decided it was worth it to hire a locksmith, who had trouble opening it himself because of the limited amount of space he had to work with.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166126.png">

6. But after a lot of effort, the locksmith was able to remove the lock.

7. Then it was finally time to open that bad boy up!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166128.png">

8. At first, he saw what looked like a pile of wet bricks. He remembered that there had been a pipe leak in his grandparents' house a few years ago, and concluded that some water had gotten into the safe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166129.png">

9. The bricks turned out to be a bunch of vintage coin books.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166130.png">

10. The moisture had damaged their covers, but the coins inside were still in pretty good condition.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166131.png">

11. There were so many items packed inside the safe. This is only a third of them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166132.png">

12. His grandma was an avid coin collector, so there were plenty of them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166133.png">

13. Some, like this silver dollar, were in mint condition because of their protective cases.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166134.png">

14. Others were only wrapped in plastic or paper, but they seemed to be fine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166135.png">

15. Unfortunately, the stacks of dollar bills he found weren't as well preserved.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166136.png">

16. Among the piles of money, there were also a few of his grandpa's antique guns and wristwatches.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166137.png">

17. He even came across a few bars of silver.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166138.png">

18. But the best part of his experience was probably discovering that this old toolbox was actually a treasure chest.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166139.png">

19. When he opened it, he was delighted to see that it was chock-full of jewelry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166140.png">

20. What an awesome farewell gift to their grandson!

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">10 Creepypasta Tales To Keep You Up All Night</a>
1. The story goes a little something like this: A Jane Doe is admitted to a hospital in the summer of 1972, and none of the nurses or doctors wish to attend to her because of her horrifyingly smooth mannequin-like appearance. Eventually, one brave doctor gets up the guts  to treat her after sheâ€™s been sedated, and she smiles, revealing sharp, pointed teeth. She proceeds to rip out the doctorâ€™s throat and proclaim "I am God" before killing the rest of the staff and disappearing, never to be seen again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202972.jpg">

2. Once upon a time in the late 1940s, Russian researchers held an experiment, keeping five political prisoners awake for fifteen days using a gas-based stimulant. Monitoring the subjects through microphones and glass portholes, the scientists left them with enough dry food for thirty days and cots with no bedding. At first, the subjects simply shared their war stories and deep emotional issues as sleep deprivation wore them down. But the subjects would become paranoid and stop communicating with each other. Then, two patients screamed until their vocal cords were shredded. All noise ceased and the researchers became worried. They would open the enclosed room to discover one subject dead and the others in various stages of self-mutilation, begging for the gas to be turned back on. It only gets worse from there.

3. In this story, a teenager heads down to Alabama to visit his extended family. With his cousins and some friends, the group goes camping in the woods and sees a bizarre creature they call "Goatman". It follows them, convulsing and speaking in tongues until it drives the group of teens into a paranoid frenzy. While thereâ€™s a ton of variations of this story, the writing of the original always gives me the heebie-jeebies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202974.jpg">

4. Hailing from Reddit, this is by far one of my favorite creepypastas. The writer posted two years ago and informed the No Sleep subreddit that his dead girlfriend was communicating with him via social media. The screenshots of the garbled messages felt real enough to give the story some credence. Not only did she keep messaging him from what should have been her inactive Facebook, but she would tag herself in recent pictures of him, in spots where she would have been had she still been alive. Her spirit messages him on Facebook for almost a year until he receives a picture taken from his hallway, peeking into his room. Read the story on Reddit to really get the full effect; even the guyâ€™s comments are downright unnerving.

5. Who doesnâ€™t love a haunted house? In this tale, an friend tells our protagonist, David, about an offer to make $500 if he can survive NoEnd House's nine rooms of torture, and he eagerly accepts. Sh*t basically gets progressively more and more messed up by each room, pushing David to the brink of sanity. The only question I have for David is, "Only $500?"

6. This story comes from another solid Reddit thread. The submitter shares a few stories about his search and rescue experiences in the woods. One involves a young boy who went missing with his sister while they were berry picking with their parents. The sister was found first and revealed that her brother was taken by a "bear man" with a strange face. He was never found. Another story was about a young woman who went hiking with her mother and grandfather. She climbed up a tree to get a better view and never came back down.

7. Have you seen this man? Maybe heâ€™s haunted your dreams. And if youâ€™ve only seen him in your dreams, it would be extremely creepy because, according to science, we only dream of faces weâ€™ve seen in real life. Thereâ€™s even a website for this guy, where you can commune with other strangers whoâ€™ve been visited by him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202978.jpg">

8. Remember those niche, often short-lived kids shows from your childhood like Cow and Chicken, Animorphs, or The Pirates of Dark Water? Well, some adults remember a puppet show from the '70s called Candle Cove. Except their memories arenâ€™t filled with laughter and cute songs, but instead marionette characters screaming endlessly at the camera for an entire episode. One viewer would ask his mother about the show, only to find out the true, horrifying nature of the show.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202979.png">

9. Robert the Doll is real, which is already pretty horrifying in and of itself. Supposedly, this doll was given to artist Robert Eugene Otto in the late 1800s by a servant working for the family, which he named after himself. The doll would begin terrorizing the family. Otto kept the doll into adulthood and it drove his late wife to pure insanity. The doll was later found by another family, but the daughter refused to have it in her room. Robert the Doll now chills out in a museum in Florida, and visitors have to politely ask permission before taking a picture of him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202980.jpg">

10. According to this story, Disney once poured 30 million dollars into opening a resort in North Carolina called Mowgliâ€™s Palace before suddenly abandoning the project. The narrator of the story searched high and low for records of Mowgliâ€™s Palace, but even the locals to Emerald Isle refused to answer questions about it. Supposedly, our protagonist found the park and photographed various parts of it that were overtaken by nature. He soon discovers the Employees Only section, with evidence that the place had been abandoned in a hurry, as though it were suddenly evacuated. From there, he finds a room marked "CHARACTER PREP 1" and then it all just goes to sh*t.

## <a href="#link1" id="link0">11 Real Life Mysteries Even The X-files Team Couldn't Solve</a>
1. The Frog Boys.
In 1991, 5 South Korean boys between the ages of 9 and 13 inexplicably went missing after saying they were going out to catch frogs. A massive search went on, with over 300,000 police officers and volunteers looking for the boys. The parents even quit their jobs to focus on finding the kids. Eleven years later, a man was out in the woods looking for acorns when he came across the bodies of the boys. What was even more mysterious is that they were found in an area that was searched multiple times.
Initially, it looked as if they boys died of hypothermia, as they were pretty decomposed, but further investigation discovered that they were murdered. So far no suspects had been found and even if they did figure it out, the statute of limitations on murder expired in 2006 (15 years), so there’s nothing they can do and the case remains unsolved and super mysterious.

2. The Toxic Lady.
Gloria Ramirez was fighting an advanced case of cervical cancer in 1994, when she was rushed into the hospital suffering from confusion, irregular heart beat and trouble catching her breath. When nurses tried to sedate her to calm her down, they found that nothing was working. They decided to defibrillate her heart to get her normal rhythm back, when the noticed that she was covered in an oily sheen and her breath smelled like a fruity, garlic-y mix. As well, when they drew blood, it smelled like ammonia.
As soon as the blood was drawn, however, nurses started feeling nauseous and fainting and after 3 of them fainted, they evacuated the emergency room. Over 23 people became sick, and 5 were so bad that they had to be hospitalized. A special crew, in hazmat gear, went into the hospital to care for her, but Gloria soon succumbed to kidney failure. To date, no one knows what what it was about Gloria that made her so toxic and affected the hospital staff.

3. The Reincarnation of the Pollock Twins.
John Pollock and his wife Florence were the parents of two girls; 6-year old Jacqueline and 11-year old Joanna in England. In the spring of 1957, the Pollock girls were killed in a hit and run while walking to church. John and Florence prayed endlessly for more kids and a year later they were blessed with twin daughters – Gillian and Jennifer, and the couple insisted all throughout the pregnancy that the babies were going to be a reincarnation of their lost children.
As soon as they took a look at the newborns, they were proven right. They noticed some eerie similarities to their lost daughters. Jennifer had a white line across her forehead and a birthmark on her leg, the same as Jacqueline. When the girls were 3 months old, the family moved away. Four years later, they came back to their hometown and weird shit started happening. The toddlers recognized places they shouldn’t have and had memories they hadn’t experienced. There was even an incident where a car drove too close to them, and the girls freaked out saying the car was out to get them.

4. Skinwalker Ranch is a portal to nightmares.
Here’s a case where the name is already scary enough before you know what’s really going on. The name comes from a native tradition of a creature that looks can disguise itself as an animal for the purposes of tricking humans. In this case, this Utah ranch is known for its UFO sightings, poltergeist activity, floating orbs, portals to other worlds and unexplained phenomena.
Over the years, scientists, ghost hunters and writers have spent time on the ranch to learn the secrets, but so far have come up empty. Some say it’s because the land (like every horror movie trope) sits on Native ceremonial lands, or that the membrane between our world and other worlds is thin there, but ultimately, there’s no one, true answer.

5. Creepy Voice Inside the Car.
Usually road trips are full of excitement and joy, because you’re headed towards somewhere fun and sometimes the journey is just as awesome as the destination. Unless some ghostly shit happens; then it’s not so fun.
There’s a story that was making its rounds on the internet, about a road trip, where an 11-year-old girl was in a car with her aunt and friends, and they were following two cars. They were driving through an industrial area, when the first car made an unexpected turn, forcing the car in front of them and their driver to make a sharp dogleg down a side street.
In that moment, they heard a loud, clear voice in the car say “Sharp bend, hm?” Their driver immediately hit the brakes; the voice didn’t come from any of them. They noticed, at that time, that the other car in front of them had stopped as well. That driver got out with a scared face and asked them if they heard it too. Everyone heard the same thing. Two separate cars, two separate families, one clear voice in a deserted area.

6. The Chipotle Triangle.
Another story from the internet, a man and his girlfriend had a craving for Chipotle, so they headed to the nearby shopping area. When they pulled in at 5pm on a Friday evening, they found an empty parking lot. There were no tables set up outside, no cars in the parking spots and no lights on inside the building. Confused, he went to drive around the building in order to leave, thinking that it was closed, and they saw a firetruck parked alongside the building, with its headlights on, but no emergency lights and no-one near the truck. Coming around the building they saw something freaky.
By the time they made it back to the front of the building, they saw every parking spot was full, there were tables outside with patrons and all the lights were on, with people dining and doing takeout. As well, the firetruck was gone, as if it’d never been there.

7. The Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter.
This is a strange alien encounter that somehow makes all the sense or no sense at all, depending on how you look at it. In 1955, a family of 5 adults and 7 kids rushed into the Hopkinsville police station in Kentucky, to report an alien invasion. They claimed that for the past few hours, they’d been battling 12-15 aliens on their property. All they saw were red eyes staring at them in the darkness, floating from tree to tree and that they were impenetrable by bullets.
Police were concerned that this was a prank, so they visited the property, only to find the expected bullet holes, but no other evidence. The next day, the police came back to follow up, only to find the family had fled in the middle of the night after another invasion, according to a neighbour.

8. The Man Who Ate Everything.
We all know someone who just happens to be able to eat anything and everything and not even gain a pound. In fact, they claim they never feel full. Turns out there’s someone who really had that condition. In the 18th century, there was a Frenchman by the name of “The Insatiable Tarrare.” According to historians, his hunger never ceased. He had a large mouth with stained teeth and he ate everything in sight, and no one knew why.
According to the stories, his belly was distended from eating so much, he sweated constantly and emitted an unbearable door. He’d swallow everything in his quest to feel full, including stones, baskets of fruit, and some even say live animals. He was staying in a military hospital at one point in his life, when a 14-month old went missing. It was suspected that he ate the child, as at the time they discovered the child missing, he was in the morgue, trying to eat dead bodies. After he was expelled from the hospital, he disappeared for a while, only to return 4 years later with tuberculosis and violent diarrhea that ultimately killed him. How and why he ate so much, remained a mystery.

9. The Hinterkaifeck Unsolved Murder.
Usually it’s the unsolved murders that are great inspiration for TV show plots, but this one takes the cake. In 1922, a German family was found murdered with their maid and no one knows how or why.
Days before the crime, the dad asked his neighbours if they knew why there was one set of footprints in the snow leading to his house. He then claimed that he heard footsteps in the attic and that a set of keys were missing. Finally, the maid that was killed was on her first day with the family, as the previous maid had quit on account of her believing the farm was haunted.
Even more eerie, is that while the evidence suggests that there might have been someone hiding there before the murder, there was stronger evidence that the perpetrator had actually stayed on the farm for a few days after killing the family. Then he disappeared. The murder remains unsolved.

10. The Overtoun Suicide Bridge.
Since the 50’s and 60’s, Overtoun Bridge has been the site of some mysterious dog deaths. There’s something about the bridge, that causes dogs to break away from their leashes and jump over the side, especially dogs with long snouts. In all cases, the weather had nothing to do with it, and it’s always in the same spot. Scientists and animal trainers have tried to figure out what it is about this particular bridge, but so far, no one has an idea.
Now, dogs are strongly forbidden, if not banned, on the bridge for the risk that they’d try to jump over and fall 50 feet to their death.

11. The Most Haunted Road in America.
This is supposedly the most haunted road in the US, based on the creepy shit that people have claimed have happened to them. Whether or not they’re verified, Clinton Road in NJ is the centre of a lot of urban myths and paranormal encounters.
This 10-mile long road of twists and turns has been long associated with ghosts, from rumours of a secret meeting place for Satanists, to a ghost of a boy who drowned decades before, to even ghost cars that chase motorists down the road. The most common ghostly apparition is of animals that stalk the forest and the road, and most claim it’s the ghosts of abused animals from the now closed “Jungle Habitat” park that used to be in the area. In any case, it’s a spooky stretch of road with a lot of scary shit.

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">28 Restaurant Secrets From Insiders that  Most Customers Don't Know</a>
1. Arbys roast beef is a compressed block of beef scraps. the block of scraps comes sitting in a bag of beef  broth and is warmed until it's ready to be served.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/15/123257/87305301/Beef.jpg">

2. I worked in a fancy country club ($25K initiation fee, then $7K/year in the 90s). A slice of "homemade" cheesecake was $7 each on the menu. One of the sous chefs stopped by the Giant Food grocery store every day on the way to work to pickup a whole cheesecake for about $5.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300118.jpg">

3. Ice machines are RARELY cleaned out. Like almost NEVER. Bugs, dirt, food particles, whatever. At two previous restaurant jobs, I felt bad that customers were getting gross ice (both places had a single machine) and mentioned it to my managers at the time. They both brushed it off as having better things to do with my time, so I used to "accidentally" kick the plug out of the wall in the evenings, come in the next day, and find a half-melted ice machine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300120.jpg">

I was stuck cleaning it, but it was worth it since I felt better about the ice being served. We had to use ice from the store down the street for the rest of the day, but it wasn't like it cost the restaurants much money. One bartender told me he would "accidentally" drop/break a glass into an ice machine to serve the same purpose if the management wasn't being cool about it. Broken glass = scoop out and dump all the ice, and might as well clean the thing since it's empty.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300123.jpg">

4. Back when I was a fry cook, some customers thought they were being slick and would order unsalted fries to make sure they got fresh ones. Us cooks would just put already salted fries back into the fryer to wash the salt off.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300121.jpg">

5. Veggie burgers were grilled on the same grill as the meat, and were often cooked in the grease of other burgers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300122.jpg">

6. Maybe not a "secret secret" but just not something people realized.At Wendy's, the cooked burgers that don't get sold, those go into a pot in a refrigerator, and they get made into TOMORROW's chili.The crispy chicken that doesn't get sold today? Those go into a pot in the fridge and those get made into TOMORROW's crispy chicken salads.Back when Wendy's had a salad bar ... the burger buns that are going stale at the end of a day? Those got made into tomorrow's garlic bread on the salad bar.None of this is unsafe, all of this is approved by the department of health, and none of this is a trade secret ... but I bet you didn't realize that.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300124.jpg">

7. Papa John's employees are always high. Always.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300125.jpg">

8. Ex Starbucks barista.-  All the pastries come frozen and we defrost them. We think they're overpriced too, don't complain about the price, if it's too expensive for you then Starbucks is not the place for you. Everything is overpriced here, DD is cheaper and even cheaper is just going to the grocery store-Lots of syrups are made with milk and/or honey so they're not vegan; this is problematic for customers who pay extra for soy milk because they want to avoid animal products-Cleanliness and freshness really depends on the individual location.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300126.jpg">

I worked at a 24/7 location with some of the highest traffic in the US (comparable to Times Square Starbucks) and I assure you that hardly anything was properly sanitized and things were not always fresh. We tried but it's very hard to keep up with cleaning and such when you have 50 customers in line and people yelling at you wondering where their drink is-If you're rude, and chances are you might get decaf shots. Cause f**k you. Or if you're rude and you order a skinny drink someone might use real syrup (may it go straight to your a*s, b***h!)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300127.jpg">

But no one would ever do anything other than this pettiness, it would be super f****d up to actually ruin someone's drink or make it gross-If it's rush hour and you ask for a complicated drink, we hate you-We're supposed to regularly check, and log the temperatures of the milk carafes that are available for customers to use but we get so busy that the milk usually has been sitting out for hours, rising above safe temperatures.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300128.jpg">

The ice machines are probably nasty. I don't think we ever cleaned ours in my 2 years there-Iced coffees and iced teas are automatically sweetened using "simple syrup." You can switch to another syrup free of charge or ask for fewer pumps of syrup if you prefer it unsweetened. We are supposed to sanitize the foaming nozzle between drinks; the container holding the sanitizing agent gets super nasty very quickly from all the milk but it doesn't get switched often-During rush hour, baristas often leave the milk jugs out rather than return it to the fridge between use because you're pouring milk literally every 30 seconds. Unfortunately, this means the milk temperature rises above safe levels and bacterial growth duplicates-Please don't order a special "secret menu" drink. There is no secret f*****g menu.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300129.jpg">

Tell us what strips you want in it and we can make it but if you just tell us a ridiculous name (snickers crunch frappuccino!) chances are we have no clue how to make that and we probably will make it up. It probably will end up tasting fine anyways.. Unless you're used to having it made one way and suddenly someone makes it up using different ingredients-When you approach the cashier, put down your phone and know what you want to order. Be polite, not rude! It's crazy how many times people come up and are like "hold on, I'm getting a drink for my friend, let me call her real quick." Um no.

9. We buy tiny wine bottles for $7 and sell for $37. Spaghetti Factories house wine is Franzia box wine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300131.jpg">

10. The only thing that is fresh and healthy, not pre-made, bagged and/or frozen at like all fast food places. Is the tomatoes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300132.jpg">

11. Health inspection is really kind of a sham. Health inspectors tend to inspect all the restaurants in an area around the same time. When the inspector shows up at one restaurant the manager will typically notify the other restaurants in the area.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300119.jpg">

I worked at Taco Bell. When we got a call from the BK down the street that the health inspector was there, we knew he would be showing up at our place sometime in the next week. We would call in extra people to do a deep cleaning of everything. It did not matter that most of the year every time we hosed out under the fryer or food prep lines, we drowned hundreds of roaches. When the health inspector showed up everything was clean, so we still had a 100% on our health inspection.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300133.jpg">

12. I work at Taco Bell, and you DO NOT want to see how the meat comes into the store. The meat we use for the tacos and other things of the sort comes in big plastic bags labeled "Suitable for human consumption". They smell absolutely awful until we put the seasonings in. Yeah, don't go to Taco Bell.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300134.jpg">

13. Not gonna say which chain but the one i used to work at was very clean and well managed. The only real secret we had was...well... Nobody was drinking the sodas they thought they were. We didn't use regular syrup in the fountain machines. If you ordered a coke, you got "panda cola". If you ordered a 7-up you got "panda lime-up".Sorry...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300135.jpg">

14. I worked at mcdonalds, and the mcrib if left out raw, melts into a liquid
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300136.jpg">

15. Zoup! The Fresh Soup Company: All the soups are frozen. They come in frozen and if there are leftovers at the end of the night they are refrozen and served another day. Pretty standard for fast - casual dining, but I found it unusual considering "fresh soup" is in the name.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300137.jpg">

16. Most of our desserts are purchased from the Wal-Mart directly across the street then marked up 500%. For the price of a couple of pieces of cheesecake, you could just go across the street to Wal-Mart after your meal and buy a whole one.We just drizzle a bit of chocolate or raspberry sauce on it so that it doesn't look exactly like the one from Wal-Mart.Also, a smoker outside the building doesn't mean your barbecue is fresh. Most of it is frozen. Sometimes we just throw logs on there so it looks and smells like we're barbecuing. Homey, we made that shit two days ago. That's just wood you're smelling.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300138.jpg">

17. My brother services coffee machines in restaurants. Never, *EVER* get coffee from McDonalds.Ever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300139.jpg">

18. Candy man here. We left chocolate out in display cases for months on end. When my friends came by to the store I told them to avoid it at all costs.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300140.jpg">

19. I saw a cook at Ihop f**k up an omelet and put the wrong sauce on it, he just washed it off in the sink and than tossed it back on the grill.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300143.jpg">

20. Whenever we have ingredients that is going to expire or just expired, we tell our cashiers to subtly "promote" certain foods when a customer seems unsure about what to buy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300144.jpg">

21. At KFC, we were supposed to change the fryer oil every couple days. Our penny-pinching manager had us change it every couple weeks. We'd just skim off the 'floaters' and cover it at night.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87300145.jpg">

22. I worked at a fried chicken joint during my teenage years. The owner refused to let us throw away chicken pieces that have gone bad to where you'd gagged if you smell them.We battered them up, fried em and served them to unsuspecting customers.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">11 Viral Photos That Have Been Debunked as Fakes</a>
1. "What happened to a rainforest over the course of 10 years."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894080.jpg">

2. This photo collage became a hit thanks to the popular #10YearChallenge. The picture is accompanied by text that says that every year, 46,000 to 58,000 square miles of forest are lost to deforestation. The photo looks real especially because of the logo in the right corner. But in fact, this is not a collage of 2 pictures taken 10 years apart, it is one picture from a photo stock. It shows Malasia where the rainforest was removed to increase the territory for growing palm trees.

3. A photographer captures a perfectly timed photo of a man cooking rice.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894082.jpg">

4. Well, it turns out the rice is actually fake. In fact, everything is fake. It’s simply a sculpture that you can buy in a shop in Tokyo.

5. A graffiti scene perfectly reflected in the water.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894084.jpg">

6. This photo became a hit on many websites. But the truth is, it was edited. Yes, this graffiti really exists and the building is located in Mariampol, Lithuania. And the author of the picture is a street artist named Ray Bartkus who drew the picture upside-down on purpose — for it to be reflected in the water. But the best time to see the picture is when there is no wind and the surface is perfectly smooth. Otherwise, the picture looks like this. See how the reflection in the first photograph was edited?

7. A lynx and a deer were found in an office under a table. They were hiding from fires in California.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894086.jpg">

8. “A fawn and a bobcat cub found under a desk in an office building after the California forest fire rolled through” is what the caption for the viral photo said on Reddit, Twitter, and other social media sites. Yes, the photo is real but it’s posted every time a forest fire breaks out somewhere in the US. And the caption is different every time. The picture was taken in May 2009 in a building that is owned by a non-commercial team of animal rescuers. During a fire in Santa Barbara, California, these cute animals were found not far from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ranch. And because there were no cages, the fawn and the lynx had to be put in an office. The lynx just ran toward the deer and lied down next to it. By the way, one of the rescuers took the animals home because he was worried they would not survive in the wild. Later, he even shared a video with the grown-up lynx — he turned out to be very cute!

9. The New Year in Paris.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894088.jpg">

10. This popular picture shows hundreds of fireworks that were supposedly launched in Paris on New Year’s Eve. Unfortunately, the photo is fake and we found several pieces of evidence. First of all, on New Year’s Eve, the fireworks are launched from the Eiffel Tower. Secondly, all the fireworks in the photo are at the same distance from the camera. And finally, the Internet users who live in Paris claim that this is a fake picture. Just take a look at the picture of the real fireworks show above the Eiffel Tower on July 14.

11. A dog sleeping on the grave of its owner every night for 7 years.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894090.jpg">

12. Almost 60,000 likes and more than 55,000 shares were made by users when they saw the post about a dog that sleeps on a tombstone. The caption says that the dog named Captain has been visiting his owner’s grave for the last 7 years and sleeping there until morning. This photo is absolutely real and so is the story. The problem is, they’re not connected. For example, the same story was linked to a different dog sleeping on a grave as well.

13. A typical day in Russia”. You can see this photo with a similar title (for example, “Polar Express”) on the Internet. It is said that the photo shows a real white bear getting off the tram somewhere in Russia. You’d be surprised but the photo is absolutely real — it was taken in a town in the Czech Republic and it wasn’t edited. But the bear is not real — it’s a costume that 2 Greenpeace activists were wearing. This “bear” was a part of the campaign, Save the Arctic. It “walked” in European cities to attract attention to the problems in the Arctic.

14. A goose frozen to a pipe warmed a puppy with its wing. At the end of January, hundreds of thousands of people on social media liked and shared the photo of a shivering goose that froze to a pipe and was warming a puppy with its wings. Allegedly, they were found in Montana. Even though the photo seems to be real, it was taken a very long time ago and most likely, it wasn’t in the US. And on top of all that, the story itself is most likely a lie. These pictures have been shared on Chinese websites since 2017. The earliest post we were able to find was made in March 2017 on NetEase — it’s is a Chinese news platform. The text under these photos says that the puppy was sitting at the side of the road, freezing. Ducks were passing by and the puppy ran toward one of them and it covered it with its wing. NetEase actually allows users to post their own content. So that means that they give their own description to the photos and there is no way to find out if the photo is real or not.

15. A mountain shaped like a turtle’s head.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894094.jpg">

16. In January 2019, Amazing Nature on Facebook posted a photo that shows a mountain that looks like a turtle. The post went viral but this mountain doesn’t actually exist — the photo was made by combining several pictures. For example, here are 2 of them.

17. A megalodon’s tooth in a whale vertebrae. The photo above shows fossils that look like a megalodon’s tooth and a whale’s bone but they were found in different places at different times. But one talented seller just combined them into one sculpture. This is what the owner of the artifact said about it. And if this were a real megalodon’s tooth stuck in a whale’s vertebrae, it would cost millions of dollars and would most likely be in an archaeological museum.By the way, this photo was first found online in 2012 and you could even buy the “artifact” for just $125.

18. A cruise ship dumping waste into the sea. The caption to this photo that was published on Facebook not long ago says that this cruise ship is dumping waste right into the sea. This post went viral and users started leaving bad comments and even the national director on the environment of Uruguay had to provide an explanation. In his Twitter account, he wrote that this photo shows the cruise ship starting its turbines in order to drop an anchor. And the brown spots are the sand and the sludge from the bottom.

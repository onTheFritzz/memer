## <a href="#link7" id="link6">25 Times People Regretted Their Online Shopping Choices</a>
1. Don't buy clothing online from China!
Chances are you WON'T be getting what you're promised.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297670.jpg">

2. They ordered a custom family photo ornament.
Instead, they received one of a random Asian family and photoshopped penguins.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297671.jpg">

3. There was an angle he didn't get to see when he ordered his new work boots.
It must be awkward to be walking behind this man and seeing his foot prints.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297672.jpg">

4. Expectation versus reality!
Should have known from the price alone!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297673.jpg">

5. He ordered a 1/2 inch solenoid valve from Amazon.
Instead he received a 7-foot tall teddy bear. But it looks like they enjoyed playing an Xbox game together.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297674.jpg">

6. He bought an Apple watch for $600 off Ebay.
This is what he received. This is the epitome of deception.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297675.jpg">

7. Target ordered "blank name badges."
So they received blank name badges. What's the problem here?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297676.jpg">

8. He ordered an Xbox and received a pistol.
Perhaps this means use the pistol to retrieve an Xbox?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297677.jpg">

9. This person got a fake Sharpie.
A Skerple?! Really?! Of all things that can be fake.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297678.jpg">

10. The boss bought 50 chairs in an online auction.
Unfortunately they didn't find out until they picked the chairs up that it was from an elementary school.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297679.jpg">

11. These hiking boots he ordered online look a little different than what he was expecting.
But he rocks them nonetheless! Don't think they'll be much of help during hiking though.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297680.jpg">

12. He ordered some Jordans online.
He wound up getting one with a butt crack. He assed for it!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297681.jpg">

13. He ordered a fryer on Amazon.
Instead, they sent him a cotton candy machine. I see no reason to be upset here.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297682.jpg">

14. They ordered a desk lamp from Amazon without reading the specs.
Is the lamp small or is the phone really just that big?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297683.jpg">

15. The original order was for black sweat pants.
Received these instead... but he's not even mad. I wouldn't be either.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297684.jpg">

16. He ordered some tights online for Halloween.
He didn't check the size prior to ordering and wound up receiving a pair that were a bit too small.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297685.jpg">

17. This mask of ultimate horror.
I do not see Winnie the Pooh at all in this face mask.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297686.jpg">

18. She ordered a jacket from Target and got this instead.
They don't even have this item in their inventory.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297687.jpg">

19. He bought this shirt online and now he's getting a lot of weird looks.
To top it off, I bet the shirt is made in China.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297688.jpg">

20. Don't buy a TV from unreliable vendors.
You'll regret it deeply. Learn from other people's mistakes right here!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297689.jpg">

21. Cat: "I am not entertained, human..."
Moral of the story: always check the dimensions before ordering on Amazon.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297690.jpg">

22. What you were hoping to get versus what you really get.
Does this remind anyone else of the Charlie Brown special?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297691.jpg">

23. He ordered an extra large.
Maybe it was an extra large for kids... That sounds more like it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297692.jpg">

24. She ordered a powder blue ukulele for a 3-year-old for Christmas.
It appears they didn't quite get her order right. And this is definitely not appropriate for a 3-year-old.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85297693.jpg">

25. They ordered an "M" balloon from Party City.
Didn't know PartyCity sells Jeff Koons' artwork!

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Guy Learns The Hard Way That Putting Your Dick Into A Vacuum Is A BAD Idea</a>
1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85438028.jpg">

2. “I don’t know if I’m the only one who has ever thought of doing this, but I had this long running fantasy of sticking my dick into the hose of a vacuum cleaner, turning it on, and having it suck me off. One day, when my entire family went to an event leaving me at home, I decided to seize upon this opportunity and try it out. There were several problems to contend with, however.
The first of these problems was the fact that the wet-dry vac I was using(for fear of what jizz would do to the inside of a dry-only vacuum) wasn’t the cleanest thing in the world. Not only that, but the hose head had a slight lip around it that had become almost jagged from scraping away at the floor. What made this even less comfortable is that I didn’t even have any lubricant, so I just tried to use shampoo to reduce friction.
Sliding it in wasn’t very pleasant, but what I had failed to take into consideration was the fact that my dick wasn’t exactly as wide as the vacuum cleaner hose was, so when I turned the thing on, my dick started violently knocking into the inner wall of the hose.
At this point, my windsock of a dick starts to hurt a little bit. Even still, I decide to try a little harder. That is when I realized my ultimate misstep: I had no idea what to do with the hose to get me off. So, I started in the most natural place to start, which, for me, was rubbing it up and down my shaft. Remember that jagged ring around the end of the hose? Well, I didn’t, at least until I start sliding the hose down, at which point I felt as if a million little knives were cutting into my dick, a problem only exacerbated by the lack of lubrication. Any resistance provided by the shampoo was lost to the suction of the vacuum cleaner.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85438029.gif">

3. “At this point, I decided that there was truly no point in continuing, because I was in far too much pain to get off. So, I slid the hose off of my dick before turning the machine off. That was my last mistake. I should have turned the thing off first, because when I was sliding my dick out, it rattled even more violently the less that was in there, to the point where the head was getting bounced like a beach ball against the jagged edge of the hose. That was the worst of the pain for sure.
When I finally recovered my dick from the vacuum cleaner, it was beet red. I had gotten properly tenderized. There were parts that had a little skin scraped off which started to scab shortly thereafter. Between the soreness and the scabbing, I was unable to masturbate for a week, and it was mildly painful for the rest of the month.
TL;DR: Stuck my dick into the hose of a vacuum cleaner to try to get off, got tenderized so bad I was unable to masturbate for the better part of a month. But, hey, at least I didn’t get an infection!”

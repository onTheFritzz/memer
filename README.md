## <a href="#link5" id="link4">17 Famous Ghosts Pictures That Can't Be Explained</a>
1. Child at the Railroad Crossing. Several children were killed at a railroad crossing located in San Antonia, Texas. Locals will tell you that their ghosts still linger at the spot, and will push idle cars across the track – even though the path is uphill.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787043.jpg">

2. Freddy Jackson. A squadron of the Royal Air Force assembled to take a mundane photograph, but after the picture was developed the squad quickly realized that this was no ordinary picture. Standing behind one of his mates was the two days deceased Freddy Jackson. He had been working when he was killed in a freak-accident by an air plane propeller. Several of the other men in the photo confirmed that it was in fact Jackson’s face in the background of the picture.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787044.jpg">

3. The Madonna of Bachelor’s Grove. Bachelor’s Grove Cemetery, located in Illinois, is considered to be one of the most haunted places in the world. This picture depicts a lady resting on a bench, but there wasn’t anyone else in the cemetery at the time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787045.jpg">

4. Back Seat Driver. This famous ghost photograph was taken in 1959 by Mable Chinnery. After visiting the grave of her mother, Mable turned and took a picture of her husband, who was waiting for her in the car.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787046.jpg">

5. The Bell Witch. Back in the 1800’s, a Tennessee farmer was reported to be at the mercy of an executed witch. John Bell documented all sorts of harassment, which included noises in the walls, being pinched, slapped, having objects thrown at him and animals being spooked with no visible cause.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787047.jpg">

6. Lord of the Chair. Lord Combermere was killed by a horse drawn carriage back in 1891. While waiting for the family to return from the funeral, the photographer snapped this photo of Combermere’s favorite chair.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787048.jpg">

7. The Ghost of Boothill Graveyard. Terry Clanton snapped a photo of his friend dressed as a cowboy in a famous Arizona graveyard. When he had the photos developed, he was shocked to see a man dressed as a cowboy in the background. “I know there was no other person in this photograph when I shot it,” Clanton insists.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787049.jpg">

8. The Brown Lady of Raynham Court. In the 18th century, Lady Dorothy Townshend was locked away when her husband found out she was having an affair. She died under mysterious circumstances in 1726 and sightings of a female figure on the stairs began shortly after.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787050.jpg">

9. Corroboree Rock Spirit. Taken by Reverend R.S. Blance at Corroboree Rock, Northern Territory, Australia in 1959, this famous photograph appears to show a woman holding her hands toward her face peering out into the distance.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787051.jpg">

10. The Farm Ghost. Neil Sandbach was out taking a few scenic shots of a farm in Hertfordshire, England. Sandbach was astonished whenever he had the film developed, and noticed a little boy. When he asked the locals about it, several admitted to seeing a young boy in white night clothes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787052.jpg">

11. The Ghost of Grandpas Past. Denise Russell snapped a photo of her grandmother and claims she inadvertently captured her deceased grandfather in the background.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787053.jpg">

12. Amityville Horror Ghost. Not everyone realizes that the movie was inspired by real events that happened to a family on Long Island. This picture was discovered among evidence taken by actual demonologists who investigated the house in 1976. No children were present in the house at the time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787054.jpg">

13. The Tulip Staircase Ghost. A photo taken by Reverend Ralph Hardy of ‘The Tulip Staircase’ at the National Maritime Museum in England depicts an eerie figure. Experts who have studied the original negative have universally concluded that the film had not been tampered with.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787055.jpg">

14. The Fire Girl. In 1995, Wem Town Hall in England caught fire. No one was inside, but snapshots revealed the image of a young girl believed to be Jane Churm who, in 1677, accidentally started a fire that destroyed many homes in the town.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787056.jpg">

15. The Stanley Hotel’s Haunted Piano. Guests have said Flora, an artist who died in this Colorado hotel long ago, returns to play the piano every now and then, and she’s just one of many spotted there. No wonder it inspired Stephen King to write ‘The Shining.’
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787057.jpg">

16. The Grey Lady of Hampton Court. A ghostly figure was caught on surveillance slamming doors near one of King Henry the VIII’s favorite spots. Some say it’s Henry’s 5th wife, Catherine Howard, who was dragged out screaming after being accused of adultery.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787058.gif">

17. Disney’s Haunted Mansion Ghost. A 2009 YouTube video — presumably of Disneyland surveillance footage — shows a grim grinning ghost cruising around Diseyland’s Haunted Mansion and Rivers of America areas after hours. The Park was totally empty, giving him plenty of space to roam around the sidewalks and grass. He even walks on water near the end of the tape.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">Man Pays $3,000 DMV Tax Bill With 300,000 Pennies!</a>
1. After months of frustration with the DMV, Nick Stafford had finally had enough and chose a weighty way to express himself: thousands and thousands of pennies.
He delivered the $2,987.14 he owed in taxes in five wheelbarrows weighing a combined 1,548 pounds. It took employees more than 12 hours to count them by hand after the DMV's coin counting machines broke.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85240811.jpg">

2. These pennies were not from heaven as much as from Nick's petty, spiteful soul. His frustration started when he tried to find out where to register a new car. He has four houses across two counties, so he needed to contact someone to get a straight answer, which took a lot of work.
After his call was routed to a call center, where he spent an hour on hold before giving up, he filed a Freedom of Information Act request for a direct line. Even then he had to call repeatedly to get his question answered.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85240812.jpg">

3. After that, he was incensed – and motivated. “If they were going to inconvenience me then I was going to inconvenience them,” he said. So Nick filed three lawsuits, one of which requested direct phone numbers to nine other local DMVs that his local DMV employees refused to provide.
His lawsuits were dismissed when the state handed over a list of the phone numbers in court
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85240813.jpg">

4. Of course, he wasn't quite done proving his point. There was still the matter of almost $3,000 in taxes on his cars. Nick's act of defiance didn't come cheap. He had to hire 11 people to break open rolls of pennies with a hammer, paying them $10 an hour.
Between that, $400 in wheelbarrows, and $165 to file the lawsuits, he spent $1005 on his stunt.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">24 Rabbitholes You Can Get Lost In Online</a>
1. Sleep paralysis audio / visual hallucinations across cultures throughout history. It’s disturbing. -u/Trek1973
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275676.jpg">

2. Cryptozoology. Its interesting to say the least but there are so many things that make you question what is out there in the world that we haven’t discovered yet. When I first got into it I thought cryptids were more like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster but there are hundreds or even thousands of other weird and unusual sightings of creatures many haven’t even heard of. -u/odagled86
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275677.jpg">

3. Caving and Cave Diving accidents. Accidentally watched one in YouTube, then went down the rabbit hole. This led to some more parallel topics of horrible fates, bad deaths etc. After few days, started getting disturbed sleep as this became my routine of watching before the sleep time. With self restraint, finally I got out of it. -u/insomniac_observer

4. This should give you an hour or two. List of unusual deaths.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_deaths -u/Krabbi

5. When I worked at a call Centre we often had quiet times and the internet blocked most things unusual wiki articles kept me entertained for quite some time though, it’s full of random strange things. -u/slimjoel14
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275680.jpg">

6. Fire disasters. And then never feel safe in an indoor crowded space ever again.There's actually video on YouTube of the Great White disaster and it's utterly horrifying how incredibly quickly it happens and seeing the people literally stuck in the doorway unable to get out as they burn to death. As someone who still goes to a lot of shows at small packed music venues exactly like that one (and other totally packed bars and clubs), I'm always constantly looking for exits to find the nearest escape path and it always freaks me out anytime there's any fire in any indoor space (candles/sparklers/pyrotechnics/etc). -u/SquareVehicle

7. Feral children.-u/PreviousTea9210

8. Mass hysteria. There are different kinds that have affected different cultures in different ways. Multiple times throughout history, groups of people have uncontrollably danced themselves to deaths. In other parts of the world, men can become stricken with the belief that their penis is receding into their bodies; it was often believed the only way to prevent this from happening overnight was for family members to hold their members, etc. -u/tullyinturtleterror
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275684.jpg">

9. Money laundering and how laundered money flows around the world. Most info is public from gov agencies like the CIA and State Department. -u/TyHuffman

10. The times where we have gotten close to extinction. There was a false report from a Russian radar thingy and they thought that nukes were coming to them from America, if it wasn’t for one person Nuclear Armageddon would’ve happened because of a software glitch (Another good one is how some horrible stuff like cannibalism is legal in certain scenarios). -u/Bagel_RR

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275687.jpg">

12. Post-WWII industries. Take fertilizer, lawn care, and home gardening for example.A very specific push to get chemical fertilizers in every home, monoculture lawns that require a lot more input, and a “clean” lawn that has left us where we are now.Very silly that we strayed away from what we had previously… -u/CheeseChickenTable
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275688.jpg">

13. Prion diseases. Every single one is weird and dark. It includes cannibalism and family curses. And deers walking on two legs. And industrial farming + forced cow cannibalism. -u/gnostic-sicko

14. The wiki for the timeline for far future events. If you want to feel insignificant and learn some sh*t, check this out.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future -u/Sylvair

15. The town of Skidmore, Missouri in the US.It's sort of a small topic, but it leads in so many different directions. It's most famous for the murder of the town bully (that's a mild name for him; he was horrible) in the middle of the day, on the main street, with a bunch of witnesses, but no one has ever been arrested. But there's also the later case of a woman who was murdered and her unborn baby stolen and even later a teenager (who was related to the murdered woman) just disappeared and is thought to have been taken by a serial killer.All this in a town of fewer than 200 people. I'm not superstitious, but I also wouldn't move there.There is a documentary on Sundance about the bully, but the best introduction is a book called In Broad Daylight. From there, you just get farther and farther down tangential paths, trying to figure out wtf happened. Less info on the two later cases, but still an internet black hole you can fall into for days. -u/secondhandbanshee
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275691.jpeg">

16. The history of lobotomies and cannibalism. I have spent more time researching these topics than the time taken to write a 90-page essay. Super fascinating if you don't get grossed out. -u/Sure_Pangolin_9421
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275692.jpg">

17. The domino effect that led up to World War One and then later World War Two. It’s interesting to learn about but it’s just a clusterf*ck of easily preventable situations. -u/Jazzlike-Dog-2999
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275693.jpg">

18. Shipwrecks. Been absolutely obsessed with them the past few days, there’s so much to discover and learn about and so much corruption as well as just interesting circumstances that these huge machines go down in.And adding to that, technical diving accidents. Especially in shipwrecks. You can dive down to the sunken Andrea Doria (that wrecked because another enormous ship collided sideways into it!) ship and collect first-class dinnerware as plunder, but people have died, seemingly becoming lost in the complete darkness of the halls inside, or user error in ANY capacity, such as not having the correct oxygen tank levels leading to hallucinations and false confidence that makes you drown. -u/uglysquire
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275694.jpg">

19. Rabies. You don't quite realize how horrifying it is. -u/Arthillidan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275695.jpg">

20. Binge-watching "Mayday" (the series about plane crashes) and looking up each incident on Google/Wiki afterward. -u/buckyhermit
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275696.jpg">

21. Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade balloon accidents. -u/ashrainbowdash
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275697.jpg">

22. People who go missing. This one I'm particularly fascinated with for some reason. Maybe it's because I like this YouTuber and how he formats his videos, but I've watched this video about a missing Canadian girl three times:https://youtu.be/AzLqFYyY0bMPersonally, I think she was groomed by a dude she met online and that guy kidnapped her and is holding her captive, like the Josef guy from Austria years back. -u/Karnezar
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275698.jpg">

23. Art forgery and fakes. I’ve been watching a BBC series called Fake or Fortune where people try to get their art validated as being by an old master (They’ve had Renoir, Monet, etc). The program goes into how both modern-day and historic forgers use techniques to make a picture or sculpture look original.It sometimes also shows how corrupt the art validation world can be, with one episode showing overwhelming evidence that a picture was genuine, but the organization responsible for cataloging the original works of the artist refuses to acknowledge it.Interestingly the head of that institute is now under investigation in France for hoarding €1bn worth of “missing” artworks. -u/mbfos

24. Ask A Mortician on Youtube.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5iiEyLwSLvlqnMi02u5gQCaitlin Doughty tells fascinating stories of unusual deaths, cannibalism, historic shipwrecks/accidents, botched cremations, etc. She also has three books out on death questions and the funeral business that I've read more than once.-u/WitchInYourGarden

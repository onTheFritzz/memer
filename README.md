## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Couple Moves Into An Older Home And Find A Fallout Shelter</a>
1. When  Colleen and Chris Otcasek bought a new home in Woodland Hills, they had no idea that their new home held a pretty awesome secret. I mean, it had the usual features that you look for in a home; great kitchen large bedrooms, a huge backyard…With the except of their very own FALLOUT SHELTER!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258282.jpg">

2. The real estate agent told them that the lot had a pretty ‘unusual feature’ in the back yard; a large, concrete-lined hole. They were told that the hole used to lead to a fallout shelter from the Cold War Era, but in all honesty, no one had gone down there all this time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258283.jpg">

3. One day, they were feeling brave, so they invited someone from the local radio station and went down the rusted ladder and found an old door at the bottom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258284.jpg">

4. Inside they found a small fallout shelter, large enough for a family of four, full of everything you’d need to survive a nuclear attack. The bunker contained water, canned food, clothing, and medicine, as well as magazines and books. Everything was still pristine and vintage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258285.jpg">

5. So wondering who’d be the type of person to build a fallout shelter in the middle of a valley outside of Los Angeles, so they did a little research and contacted the media. While building a fallout shelter during the cold war was a common practice, to find one like this one, it must have had a pretty interesting story.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258286.jpg">

6. Soon they got a hit from Debrah Kaufman, who visited the couple at the house and told the couple that her father Alvin, was the one to build the shelter, back in 1961. He figured, if he built it 15 feet below ground, it would be safe enough for his family.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258287.jpg">

7. Alvin Kaufman was a self-taught nuclear engineer working as a contractor for a few companies, testing the effects of nuclear war on industry and of course, what it would do to humans. Knowing firsthand what the effects were, he wanted to do something to keep his family safe.The irony, though, is that he approached everyone in his cul-de-sac and offered to build one big enough for everyone. They said no. So he just made one for himself and his family, filled with several sleeping areas, a water tank, a hand cranked air filter and enough food to last several weeks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258288.png">

8. The shelves were full of  food from the era, all still sealed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258289.jpg">

9. This is probably the most important thing for a fallout shelter, coffee. Although this can has seen better days.

## <a href="#link1" id="link0">14 Gross Sex Stories That'll Make You Cringe </a>
1. “I decided to pull back for a second to regain my composure. I thought if I pulled open her lady-bits I might be able to have a better angle of attack on her clit. I opened up her pussy to a terrible sight. There were multiple lumps of what looked like cottage cheese dotted around her pussy lips and clit.Each lump ranged from a few millimeters in width to half a centimeter in size. It looked like some sort of fungus was growing there.”

2. “He pulled it out to come on my face, I was unprepared and snorted his semen up my nose. We started making out and I sneezed his semen onto his own face.”

3. “One Saturday afternoon, the boy is performing some world class cunnilingus when I feel a pressure at my nether orifice. I soon realized he was using some beads on me. We had some filthy and very very satisfying sex, then I went to the bathroom to clean up without removing the beads. I sat on the toilet to get the beads out. Those beads were solidly embedded in a great big turd. I just stared at it dumbly for a moment before the smell hit me.”

4. “Sixty-Nine. She came. She farted. My hair blew in it’s fetid breeze.”

5. “A girl I had been dating for awhile climbed on me for 69. As she scooted back, I saw something white, realized too late that it was a clump of toilet paper, and got it in my mouth. Pretty nasty, but I spit it out and kept going.”

6. “Having sex with my wife, and then noticing that something didn’t feel quite right, she still had a tampon in from 4 days prior…and i had to help pull it out….”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468182.gif">

7. “Sucking a chicks nipple in the dark. She was loving it. All of a sudden there is liquid.. Lactating.. sick. So keep going, she seems to be loving it. Lights come on, dun dun dunnn, I had been sucking the pus out of a boil.”

8. “Last summer my husband and I were living with roommates who had a cat. We were drinking and started getting hot and heavy, he stripped down and jumped on the bed, said something about it being wet and jumped back up. One of us had left our bedroom door cracked and the cat had gotten stuck in the room, and pooped all over our bed. Worse is that apparently this cat was sick with worms. My poor husband was covered in kitty diarrhea, blood and worms.”

9. “The grossest sexual encounter I’ve had was a guy who sweat so profusely it was dripping on me, then he flipped his sweaty ass around into my face to attempt what I can only assume was a 69 position but was more like being force fed a butt sandwich and I could see the sweat glistening on his ass/ball hair, that, and the cheese smell coming from his balls made my eyes water and I threw him off me and ran to the shower.”

10. “She smelled really horrible, and she tasted even worse. He didn’t want to offend her though because he hadn’t seen her in months…so he put a Jolly Rancher in his mouth to cover it up, even though it didn’t do much to help. In the course of eating her out, he accidentally pushed the candy inside of her… and stuck a finger in to grab it out. He took it out, and put it back into his mouth and bit it. Only…it wasn’t the Jolly Rancher. It was a nodule of gonorrhea.”

11. “So this one time I’m having sex with my girlfriend right, and it was all good and sexy so we finish up and everything seems cool.Then about 9 months later a fucking little human being comes out of her pussy! I mean just like pops out and I saw that shit with my own eyes! The little fucker is still living with us.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468187.jpg">

12. “Anal sex. Pinworms. Maybe not as gross as the OP’s story, but it’s fucking nasty to pull your dick out and see a dozen or so worms writhing around on the condom.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468188.gif">

13. “Suddenly, in one swift move, she pounced me, knocked me onto my back, jumped on top of me, spun around and started sucking me off, 69 style. I was totally into it, and started reciprocating. Only a few moments pass before I felt a tap on my forehead. My face was fully between her legs, yet there was this tap tap tap on my forehead. Every couple of seconds, tap tap tap. This tapping continued and started to take me out of the moment. I pried my face from between her legs to get a better view of what was going on. To my horror, I witnessed, dangling from her asshole, a fucking tape worm, bouncing like a fettuccine noodle with every excited movement she made.”

14. “I once had a 69 with a girl, and about halfway through it, I felt something fall down my throat. I threw her off and ran to the bathroom. It was about a half-inch glob of congealing, jelly-like burnt-red… blood.”

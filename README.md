## <a href="#link5" id="link4">25 Lethal Facts About Bruce Lee</a>
1. Bruce Lee was born in the Year of the Dragon, on the Day of the Dragon, on the hour of the Dragon. Unsurprisingly, his nickname was Little Dragon.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126413.jpg">

2. Bruce Lee’s grandfather was one hundred percent German, which technically made Lee Eurasian. This “non-pure” Chinese status prevented him from being accepted into many kung fu schools in the 1950's due to discrimination and racism.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126414.jpg">

3. During his adolescence, he was a gang leader. The name of his group was The Tigers of Junction Street.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126415.jpg">

4. It might sound a little strange, but Lee’s early life was quite similar to the one portrayed in his movies. To make a long story short, he got into a fight with the son of a triad boss in Hong Kong when he was young, and his father shipped him off to the States the next day.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126416.jpg">

5. He left for Seattle in 1958 with $100. While aboard the ship traveling to America, he gave cha cha lessons to first-class passengers to earn extra money.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126417.jpg">

6. He was able to name every karate term and perform each technique with deadly accuracy even though he was never officially taught the Japanese art of self-defense.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126418.jpg">

7. Lee had bad eyesight, which was one of the reasons he appreciated Wing Chun’s contact style of movement as he could rely more on touch than sight.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126419.jpg">

8. Bruce Lee’s favorite habit (other than martial arts, of course) was reading. He had an extensive library of more than two thousand books and read daily.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126420.jpg">

9. Contrary to the popular belief that Lee never participated in real combat competitions, he became the Hong Kong boxing champion, knocking out all his opponents including British boxer Gary Elms. He also defeated famous martial artist and teacher Wong Jack Man in a fight in 1965.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126421.jpg">

10. Bruce Lee used to puncture cans with his fingers back in the days when cans weren’t soft aluminum. He cut himself performing this on the set of The Big Boss though, so keep an eye out for the Band-Aids on his fingers next time you watch the film.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126422.jpg">

11. Time magazine named Bruce Lee one of the one hundred most influential people of the twentieth century. A few years later, in 2014, the Houston Boxing Hall of Fame voted him the Greatest Movie Fighter Ever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126423.jpg">

12. He weighed only 160 lbs. at his heaviest and was around 125 lbs. when he died.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126424.jpg">

13. He was capable of doing push-ups with a 250-pound man on his back. He could also do push-ups with only one finger.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126425.jpg">

14. Lee was chosen by Goldsea Asian American Daily as one of the “100 Most Inspiring Asian Americans of All Time,” ranked second behind Daniel K. Inouye, the influential senator and Medal of Honor recipient.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126426.jpg">

15. In the popular Nintendo game series Pokémon, the fighting-type monster Hitmonlee is based on Lee.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126427.jpg">

16. To mark the occasion of what would have been Lee’s sixty-fifth birthday (November 27, 2005), a bronze statue of a shirtless Bruce adopting a martial arts pose was unveiled in Hong Kong, effectively kicking off a week long Bruce Lee festival.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126428.jpg">

17. UFC president Dana White considers Bruce Lee “the father of Mixed Martial Arts.”

18. Bruce Lee developed an amazing trick, which you can find on YouTube, for showing off his speed: a person held a coin and closed his hand and, as he closed it, Lee would take it and could even swap the coin for another.

19. Lee mastered a technique called “the one-inch punch,” where he could deliver a devastating blow with his fist traveling only an inch before striking his opponent.

20. In his first and only meeting with composer Lalo Schifrin (they worked together on Enter the Dragon), Bruce confessed that he often trained to the Mission: Impossible theme.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126432.jpg">

21. Despite rumors and reports to the contrary, Lee was never Chuck Norris’s instructor. They trained together, often trading techniques and ideas, but never had a student-teacher relationship.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126433.jpg">

22. However, he was the one who gave Norris his first movie job, but it wasn’t in Way of the Dragon, as many people believe. Actually, it was before that, when Lee was a stunt coordinator in a film called Wrecking Crew starring Dean Martin. Bruce got Chuck one quick scene, which started with one line of dialogue followed by a fight scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126434.jpg">

23. Film directors had to shoot Lee’s fight scenes at thirty-two frames per second instead of the usual twenty-four because he was so fast; they wanted to make them seem more realistic, especially his kicks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126435.jpg">

24. At the peak of his stardom, Lee was challenged by so many people every time he was recognized in public that he used to carry a .367 Magnum. This is what happens when people everywhere want to fight you to prove their strength, I guess.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126436.jpg">

25. Bruce Lee might be the closest a real human has come to a superhero, but he had his kryptonite too: water. Lee couldn’t swim to save his life according to his younger brother, Robert, who revealed that Bruce hated the water and couldn’t swim.

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">Tragic Overdose Stories That Will Put You On The Straight And Narrow</a>
1. This viral video has left viewers divided across the Internet. Brenden Bickerstaff-Clark, 29, of Youngstown, Ohio, posted it in early October 2016 and it already has over 32 million views.

In the video, Bickerstaff-Clark is seen sitting across from his son. He holds the boy's hand and says, “Mommy died last night.” His son responds, “What?” The father confirms her death and shares that drugs caused the woman, who was not named, to die.

Bickerstaff-Clark said he recorded the moment for every addict with children. “Don't let this disease have to make someone tell your child that your dead because of drugs. This was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. My son has no mother because of heroin... kinda hard to hear but u can hear what we're saying. Please get help so our children don't have to suffer. This wasnt [sic] staged. This was real. I had someone record this so addicts with children can see the seriousness [sic] of our epidemic. I am a recovering addict myself with 94 days clean today... please share n maybe help save a childs [sic] parents life.”

2. Kelly-Mae Hemphill, 25, made headlines in February 2016 when she OD'd on a roadside in New Jersey and was brought back to life with the help of first responders. She later took to Facebook to defend her drug use saying, "Listen you stupid my daughter my daughter doesn't see t in person cuz I'm not like that when I'm around her," Hemphill wrote on Facebook. "Yes, she does not live with me so she does not see me high and you don't know what I've been through so unless you can walk in my shoes... I think you should just keep your f******* mouth shut."

Hemphill has since been busted on a bench warrant charge and had crack cocaine in her possession at the time of her arrest.

3. Two adults were found dead of a suspected overdose after their 7-year-old daughter told school officials in Pennsylvania she couldn't wake them up.

The bodies of Christopher Dilly, 26, and Jessica Lally, 25, were found in October 2016 in their McKeesport apartment. A 9-month-old girl, 3-year-old boy and 5-year-old boy who were inside the home were taken to a hospital to be evaluated and will likely stay with relatives.

4. Almost 40 "zombie" New Yorkers were seen struggling with the effects of a synthetic marijuana known as K2 in a viral video posted to YouTube in July 2016. 

K2 is sold for as little as $1 a hit, and the problem in Brooklyn all stems from one place — Big Boy Deli near Broadway and Myrtle Avenue. Locals said the deli is a frequent target of police raids. K2 contains man-made chemicals that act on the same cell receptors in the brain that THC does.

5. The Lawrence Police Department in Lawrence, MA released video footage of a two-year-old dressed in pink pajamas wailing while standing in the toy aisle of a Family Dollar store as she tried to wake her mother, who was sprawled across the floor after an apparent drug overdose. The department took possession of the video from a witness and decided to release it to raise awareness about the opioid epidemic.

The unidentified woman, a 36-year-old from New Hampshire, was transported to a local hospital. Police alerted the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and the child has since been taken into protective custody.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85168086.jpg">

6. In October 2016, video of a Tennessee couple lying on the sidewalk unconscious from a suspected heroin overdose went viral. Police said the couple snorted heroin in a nearby Walgreens bathroom and began to have strange reactions once outside. They were both taken to the hospital and revived. The woman, Carla Hiers, had a warrant out for her arrest and was arrested. She was held on $200 bond for offenses including leaving the scene of an accident and theft.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85168087.jpg">

7. A photo capturing an Alabama officer comforting a 1-month-old baby girl after her parents overdosed went viral in October 2016. 

When officers arrived at the Birmingham apartment of the victims, they discovered a 30-year-old man dead on the kitchen floor and a 35-year-old woman unresponsive on the couch. Four children — ages 7, 3, 2, and 1-month — were left alone and frightened. Rescuers were able to revive the mother, and she was taken to the hospital.

The moment where one of the officers, Michelle Burton, was cradling the baby was captured in a photo. Her husband, Brian, posted it on Facebook with the caption, “Last night, my wife Michelle Burton told me she would be late getting off work because of a call she was on where the parents of 4 small children had both overdosed. Michelle said the father was dead and the mother was critical. She spent the rest of the night taking care of these babies. She got home at 4 this morning. I've never seen her more beautiful than in this picture. What an incredible woman.”

8. A grandmother who became infamous after police posted a photo of her and a friend passed out in their SUV from an apparent heroin overdose — while her 4-year-old grandson sat in the back seat — has been sentenced to 180 days in jail.

Rhonda Pasek, 50, pleaded no contest to charges of endangering a child, public intoxication, and a seat belt violation. It was the latest setback for Pasek, who lives in West Virginia, across the Ohio River from East Liverpool. According to her sister, she has struggled with substance abuse addiction for many years. The man in the car, James Acord, was sentenced to 360 days in jail and also pleaded no contest to child endangering charges. He was also fined $475 and got his driver's license suspended for 3 years.

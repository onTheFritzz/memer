6. English archaeologist Howard Carter entered the sealed burial chamber of King Tutankhamen 1923.

Curse of the Tutankhamun?
The first of the “mysterious” deaths was that of Lord Carnarvon. He had been bitten by a mosquito, and later slashed the bite accidentally while shaving. It became infected and blood poisoning resulted. …
Skeptics have pointed out that many others who visited the tomb or helped to discover it lived long and healthy lives. A study showed that of the 58 people who were present when the tomb and sarcophagus were opened, only eight died within a dozen years. All the others were still alive, including Howard Carter, who died of lymphoma in 1939 at the age of 64. The last survivor, American archaeologist J.O. Kinnaman, died in 1961, a full 39 years after the event.

7. General Dwight D. Eisenhower addresses American paratroopers prior to D-Day.

Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces:
You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.
Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.
But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.
I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.
Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking

15. A Mongolian woman sentenced to die by starvation reaches out from the porthole of a crate in which she is imprisoned, c. July 1913.

This photo was taken in July 1913 by French photographer Albert Kahn. Albert Kahn was a millionaire banker who pioneered color photography using the process invented by the Lumière brothers. During his trip through exotic countries, Albert Kahn visited Mongolia where he took this picture of a woman who was condemned to slow and painful starvation by being deposited in a remote desert inside a wooden crate that was to become her tomb. Initially the bowls on the ground had water in it, though was not intentionally refilled, and the person inside was allowed to beg for food which often just prolonged their suffering as they generally didn’t get enough food for the passersby. The photographer had to leave her in the box because it would be against a prime directive of anthropologists to intervene in another cultures law and order system.

After lunch, Field Marshal Montgomery called the Germans back for further consultation, and there he delivered his ultimatum … He told the Germans: “You must understand three things: Firstly, you must surrender to me unconditionally all the German forces in Holland, Friesen and the Frisian Islands and Helgoland and all other islands in Schleswig-Holstein and in Denmark. Secondly, when you have done that, I am prepared to discuss with you the implications of your surrender: how we will dispose of those surrendered troops, how we will occupy the surrendered territory, how we will deal with the civilians, and so forth. And my third point: If you do not agree to Point 1, the surrender, then I will go on with the war and I will be delighted to do so.” Monty added, as an after-thought, “All your soldiers and civilians may be killed.”

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Conor McGregor Trolls Floyd Mayweather With A Custom Made F-U Suit</a>
1. Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor finally met face to face in the first press conferences before their big August 26th fight. The event was full of taunts by McGregor, saying he'd knock Floyd out within the first four rounds, and calling Mayweather old, but the real message was McGregor's suit, which was much quieter.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85405853.jpg">

2. McGregoer's suit, like much of everything Mcgregor does, was a promotion for his up and coming line of suits. Part-troll, part businessman, McGregor used his face to face with Mayweather to both, get into his opponent's head and to get into our pockets.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Guy Turns A 1907 Upright Piano Into A One Of A Kind Desk</a>
1. "I found an old upright piano that someone on craigslist was giving away for free. They had said that if no one wanted it, it was going to the dump. So I picked it up and hauled it back home. All the keys were stripped of it ivory so I couldn't salvaged any of it. I had this DIY project on my to do list for awhile. I finally I was able to start it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240449.jpg">

2. "I found a lumber mill that sold slabs of wood. (Please note, I do not have any carpentry skills whatsoever.) I wanted a solid piece for the desktop. I was able to get a 2 1/2in thick, 2ft wide and 6ft long board. I cut it down to fit inside where the piano keys had laid."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240450.jpg">

3. "I plained all the weather stain and uneven bowing of the wood. I used this hand liner for about 30mins and then I bought an electric plainer, because, aint nobody got time for dat."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240451.jpg">

4. "I wanted an elegant lighting system for the desk. So I was able to purchase these warm, mini, dimmable, recessed light from amazon."

5.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240453.jpg">

6. "Next was to coat the desktop. I wanted to do epoxy seeing how it was the best stuff for taking a beating. It was either this or glass, and this was cheaper... and more fun."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240454.jpg">

7. "I had to put down a top coat first."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240455.jpg">

8.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240456.jpg">

9. "Next was the flood coat."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240457.jpg">

10. "I used a blowtorch to pop the remaining bubbles."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240458.jpg">

11. "After it was done, I strongly debated weather or not I would strip the piano of its old stain and retain it, but instead I kept it because this was that piano's story. So I used feed-n-wax to polish and shine the wood."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240459.jpg">

12. "Seeing how this piano serviced the great depression, WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, and to this day, brings me such happiness, to know I have a little piece of history right in my own home."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240460.jpg">

13. "People will say that I ruined a fine piano, But I feel the opposite to that. I was able to take this piano, that was going to be thrown away, and give a new purpose in life."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85240461.jpg">

14. "In the end, there were many flaws, but I am so happy with how it turned out." What do you think? Would you do something like this?

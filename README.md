Answer: "It’s a rain and frost/ice detector. A small current is on the 2 metallic circles, they are not touching and are isolated against each other. When raindrops connect the 2 metals, the small current is amplified or switched, so it can trigger a pump or close windows that are fully open at that time and rain or snow won’t damage things."

Answer: "It’s a tray table. It has another piece to it. It’s a tray with matching pegs. The tray goes on top and the pegs slide in. They fit together, so the tray sits tightly. Then you take the tray back to the kitchen and put the sliding part back, so it’s not in the way."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297457.jpg">

23. “It’s a long tool with a metal dial on the top that you can twist, possibly related to calligraphy or a type setting.”

Answer: "It’s a drafting pen."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297458.jpg">

24. “Made entirely of metal, it was found in a residential area in France.”

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297460.jpg">

26. “A fork with tines of varying width — what is this used for?”

Answer: "It looks like a failure of quality control. When the punch came down to cut the slots, the fork blank wasn’t all the way in and was a bit cockeyed. If quality control wasn’t having an off day, it would have ended up in the bin."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297461.jpg">

28. “What is this set of ropes mounted to this wall?”

Answer: "My friend has a setup kinda like this one, and it’s a “yoga wall.” I guess there are some yoga moves where you use ropes to stretch and pose."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297464.jpg">

29. “These came in a cross-stitch kit. They’re flexible, made of rubber, and the 2 ends are magnetic, so they stick together.”

Answer: "They are magnetic cable clips that can be used to keep excess fabric out of the way when cross-stitching."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297465.jpg">

30. “Photos found from my grandpa’s collection show some sort of disc with holes being erected in a city center.”

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297466.jpg">

31. “A little red plastic and metal tool, the metal is springy. It has a lock stamped on the short end and a number 7 stamped on the flat side.”

Answer: "I believe it is a locking mechanism for a Zyliss Lock N’ Lift can opener."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87297467.jpg">

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Bank Mishap Gives Man Unlimited Funds And Unlimited Trouble</a>
1. Luke Moore opened up an account with the Australian bank St George in 2010, when he was  22. Unemployed and claiming benefits, he ran up overdrafts of $9,000 after a year.  Realizing that he basically had a  limitless overdraft he continued to withdraw and spend money.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85222723.jpg">

2. He started buying cars, boats and even signed albums by Bob Dylan and Michael Jackson. Among his purchases were lavish vacations, a £32,000 ($36K) Stessl boat, a £54,000($56K) Aston Martin and a £100,000 ($104K) Maserati.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85222724.jpg">

3. The Police were called after the Bank realized Moore owed them £1.25m ($1.4M)  They also discovered that roughly  £650,000 ($680K) of the money had been stashed in secondary bank accounts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85222725.jpg">

4. Moore was originally sentenced for obtaining financial advantage by deception and dealing proceeds of a crime.  Moore is now free and, as he told Australia's Daily Telegraph, "re-adjusting to real life,” living with his mother in Goulburn, New South Wales, and studying to become a criminal lawyer. In his appeal judgment last month Justice Mark Leeming noted that Moore had acted "extremely foolishly" - but had not deceived the bank.

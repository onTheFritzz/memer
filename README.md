## <a href="#link1" id="link0">Couple Finds Hidden Treasure In New House</a>
1. While moving all their stuff into their new house, Matt stacked some boxes into an empty closet, not paying much attention to the floor.

2. While Matt was pretty oblivious to the secret hiding under the cardboard boxes, his wife noticed a panel in the floor and said to him, "Did you know we had a trapdoor?"

3. Super curious, they quickly moved the boxes out of the way and Matt tried the handle...hoping not to find any dead bodies below.

4. The trapdoor opened easy but it looked like there was nothing but dust to be found down there.

5. But wait...what's that hiding in the corner?!

6. A box!

7. This intricate little box was sitting on plastic sheeting.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089454.jpg">

8. They tried to open it only to realize it was locked tight. Not having any idea how old and delicate it was they decided not to force it open and risk ruining the box itself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089455.jpg">

9. It was surprisingly heavy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089456.jpg">

10. Since the keyhole appeared to be intact, Matt decided to leave the box and call up a locksmith friend for help.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089457.jpg">

11. Here's a close-up of the keyhole.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089458.jpg">

12. After finding out his locksmith friend wasn't coming to explore the unopened box, overly curious Matt decided he had to try to force it open and see what was hiding inside. He grabbed his tools and got to work!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089459.jpg">

13. Using a screwdriver and a hammer, Matt got the box open in no time at all.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041457/85261674/3.jpg">

14. Oh wow! It was a little treasure chest!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089460.jpg">

15. What excited Matt and his wife the most was when they found a tiny box within the bigger one.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089461.jpg">

16. This probably explains why the thing was so heavy...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089462.jpg">

17. Here's a close-up of some of the coins, including a British 50 pence coin.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089463.jpg">

18. Some of the coins appeared to be very old, and on closer inspection...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089464.jpg">

19. ...yes, they were old! This one was over 130 years old!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089465.jpg">

20. This one cent coin was incredibly from 1859.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089466.jpg">

21. Most of the coins were American, but there were some from all corners of the world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089467.jpg">

22. While looking through the coins, Matt's wife spotted something else...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089468.jpg">

23. It was this awesome retro Silver Surfer card in a protective case.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041520/85261676/1.jpg">

24. While the coins and card were cool, there was something else in there...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041509/85261675/2.jpg">

25. ...that other tiny box!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089469.jpg">

26. What's that? Seems like this box had been outfitted with some serious tiny-lock technology.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089470.jpg">

27. Luckily, Matt's wife found the key among all the coins...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089471.jpg">

28. Tiny mystery boxeth unlocketh!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089472.jpg">

29. look at all that bling!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089473.jpg">

30. What a beautiful old collection of pocket watches, chains, and a ring.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089474.jpg">

31. It looked like two of the three watches were still functioning.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089475.jpg">

32. This ring with the old Girl Scout logo was also in the tiny box.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">10 Creepypasta Tales To Keep You Up All Night</a>
1. The story goes a little something like this: A Jane Doe is admitted to a hospital in the summer of 1972, and none of the nurses or doctors wish to attend to her because of her horrifyingly smooth mannequin-like appearance. Eventually, one brave doctor gets up the guts  to treat her after she’s been sedated, and she smiles, revealing sharp, pointed teeth. She proceeds to rip out the doctor’s throat and proclaim "I am God" before killing the rest of the staff and disappearing, never to be seen again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202972.jpg">

2. Once upon a time in the late 1940s, Russian researchers held an experiment, keeping five political prisoners awake for fifteen days using a gas-based stimulant. Monitoring the subjects through microphones and glass portholes, the scientists left them with enough dry food for thirty days and cots with no bedding. At first, the subjects simply shared their war stories and deep emotional issues as sleep deprivation wore them down. But the subjects would become paranoid and stop communicating with each other. Then, two patients screamed until their vocal cords were shredded. All noise ceased and the researchers became worried. They would open the enclosed room to discover one subject dead and the others in various stages of self-mutilation, begging for the gas to be turned back on. It only gets worse from there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202973.png">

3. In this story, a teenager heads down to Alabama to visit his extended family. With his cousins and some friends, the group goes camping in the woods and sees a bizarre creature they call "Goatman". It follows them, convulsing and speaking in tongues until it drives the group of teens into a paranoid frenzy. While there’s a ton of variations of this story, the writing of the original always gives me the heebie-jeebies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202974.jpg">

4. Hailing from Reddit, this is by far one of my favorite creepypastas. The writer posted two years ago and informed the No Sleep subreddit that his dead girlfriend was communicating with him via social media. The screenshots of the garbled messages felt real enough to give the story some credence. Not only did she keep messaging him from what should have been her inactive Facebook, but she would tag herself in recent pictures of him, in spots where she would have been had she still been alive. Her spirit messages him on Facebook for almost a year until he receives a picture taken from his hallway, peeking into his room. Read the story on Reddit to really get the full effect; even the guy’s comments are downright unnerving.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202975.png">

5. Who doesn’t love a haunted house? In this tale, an friend tells our protagonist, David, about an offer to make $500 if he can survive NoEnd House's nine rooms of torture, and he eagerly accepts. Sh*t basically gets progressively more and more messed up by each room, pushing David to the brink of sanity. The only question I have for David is, "Only $500?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202976.jpg">

6. This story comes from another solid Reddit thread. The submitter shares a few stories about his search and rescue experiences in the woods. One involves a young boy who went missing with his sister while they were berry picking with their parents. The sister was found first and revealed that her brother was taken by a "bear man" with a strange face. He was never found. Another story was about a young woman who went hiking with her mother and grandfather. She climbed up a tree to get a better view and never came back down.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202977.jpg">

7. Have you seen this man? Maybe he’s haunted your dreams. And if you’ve only seen him in your dreams, it would be extremely creepy because, according to science, we only dream of faces we’ve seen in real life. There’s even a website for this guy, where you can commune with other strangers who’ve been visited by him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202978.jpg">

8. Remember those niche, often short-lived kids shows from your childhood like Cow and Chicken, Animorphs, or The Pirates of Dark Water? Well, some adults remember a puppet show from the '70s called Candle Cove. Except their memories aren’t filled with laughter and cute songs, but instead marionette characters screaming endlessly at the camera for an entire episode. One viewer would ask his mother about the show, only to find out the true, horrifying nature of the show.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202979.png">

9. Robert the Doll is real, which is already pretty horrifying in and of itself. Supposedly, this doll was given to artist Robert Eugene Otto in the late 1800s by a servant working for the family, which he named after himself. The doll would begin terrorizing the family. Otto kept the doll into adulthood and it drove his late wife to pure insanity. The doll was later found by another family, but the daughter refused to have it in her room. Robert the Doll now chills out in a museum in Florida, and visitors have to politely ask permission before taking a picture of him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85202980.jpg">

10. According to this story, Disney once poured 30 million dollars into opening a resort in North Carolina called Mowgli’s Palace before suddenly abandoning the project. The narrator of the story searched high and low for records of Mowgli’s Palace, but even the locals to Emerald Isle refused to answer questions about it. Supposedly, our protagonist found the park and photographed various parts of it that were overtaken by nature. He soon discovers the Employees Only section, with evidence that the place had been abandoned in a hurry, as though it were suddenly evacuated. From there, he finds a room marked "CHARACTER PREP 1" and then it all just goes to sh*t.

## <a href="#link1" id="link0">19 Fascinating Pics Collected From History's Vault</a>
1. Grigori Rasputin, Russian mystic and spiritual advisor to the Romanovs and a highly influential figure in the court of Tsar Nicholas II.

Reportedly, Rasputin’s first assassination attempt occurred in 1914, when the prostitute Khioniya Guseva stabbed him in the gut with a dagger in what was thought to be a mortal wound. Eyewitnesses claim that as Rasputin’s entrails fell from his stomach Guseva shouted, “I’ve killed the antichrist.” Though Rasputin survived the attack, his demeanor changed permanently.
In 1916, the country’s distaste for Rasputin hit an all-time high, and a group of conspirators including Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Prince Felix Yusupov set out to kill him. Using Yusupov’s wife to lure Rasputin to their home, the conspirators fed Rasputin wine and cakes laced with cyanide. Though it was reportedly enough poison to kill five men, Rasputin was unaffected.
Unperturbed, the conspirators continued their attack by beating him repeatedly, then shooting him in the back and causing him to fall to the floor. Yet Rasputin, much like antibiotic-resistant pathogen, still wasn’t dead. According to some, Rasputin jumped up violently, only to be shot several more times. The men then wrapped the body in a sheet or carpet and tossed him into the Neva River.
Rasputin’s body was pulled from the water three days later. Though autopsy reports differ, most attest that he was still alive when thrown into the water and that from the positioning of his body, he had tried to break free before either drowning or dying from hypothermia. The exact cause of death has been debated for decades.

3. Women protesting forced hijab days after the Iranian Revolution, 1979.

The date was March 8, International Women’s Day, and the image shows women from all walks of life — nurses, students, mothers — marching, smiling, arms raised in protest. More than 100,000 of them. At the time, Golestan recalls, Iranian people were very “politically charged” and believed change could be effected by demonstrating in the streets. “This time they were disappointed,” she says. “From the next day everybody had to wear the scarf.”

7. The Clark Doll Experiment, 1939.

This was a test done for a Master’s thesis that involved children being presented with 2 dolls, 1 black 1 white. They asked the children which they would play with, which one is nicer/better, etc. The experiment showed a clear preference for the white doll. Some of the actual data is hard to find, but the work was accepted enough that the Supreme Court used it in Brown v Board of Education.

“Over the next few days, Ali spent over $2,000 getting the man clothes, an apartment and a job. The poor fellow broke down in tears. He couldn’t believe the heavyweight champion was helping him,” Bingham said.”
“He grasped Ali by the hands, tears running down his cheeks, and said: ‘I spent years alone after returning from Vietnam. ‘I became convinced that nobody cares whether I live or die, so I decided I would die – but you changed that for me. You have given me the strength to carry on,’” Bingham claimed.
Ali stayed in touch with the vet for years, Bingham said.
“The champ called him every few months. There’s no doubt that Ali saved his life and helped him get a new start,” he said.

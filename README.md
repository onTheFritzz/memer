## <a href="#link2" id="link1">20 Eerie Things That Happened to People Working in Morgues</a>
1. You know in the movies where the pathologist or mortician or whoever sets their sandwich on the dead guy? Nobody would ever do that in real life, right? Of course not. It was a bowl of cereal. -ITeechYoKidsArt
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035039/87313714/cereal.jpg">

2. I helped with an autopsy where a woman wasn't found for a few weeks and her cats started chewing on her. -riphitter
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035043/87313715/cats.jpg">

3. You have smelt nothing until you have smelt the farts of the dead. -TheGarp
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035049/87313716/fart.jpg">

4. Refrigeration mechanic here, our company took on a contract for a funeral home that did it all (storing, embalming, cremation etc) one of my first repairs was to replace a failed motor in their main body cooler. It’s definitely a strange feeling being the only living person in a ice box containing 25 dead bodies. -TomaszRS
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035053/87313717/fridge.jpg">

5. My best friend growing up lived in the "upstairs" of his family owned funeral home. We used to play hide and go seek in the caskets until one day one of the "empty" caskets wasn't empty because they had just gotten a "delivery" from a different funeral home. -slytherinprolly
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035100/87313718/hideseek.jpg">

6. My wife is a mortician. she's had quite a lot of wacky experiences. this is more funny than creepy, but once she was trying to break up the rigor mortis in a decedent's hip by flexing the entire leg up. her grip slipped and the leg swung down, the heel cracking her right in the face, resulting in a black eye. -iamblankenstein
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035038/87313713/blackeye.jpg">

7. Maggots crawling out of orifices always got me. -bemi_san
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035111/87313725/maggots.jpg">

8. I had a friend in Boy Scouts whose dad got a job in a morgue washing the hair of dead people. On his first job by himself, he wheeled the body under the faucet and turned it on. Then he hears a shriek and, "THAT'S COLD!" He ran out of the basement like a bat out of hell. His boss was at the door laughing his ass off as his partner crawled out from under the gurney. -Broad-Blood-9386
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035102/87313719/hair.jpg">

9. Funeral Director here. About 15 years ago I had a lady whose husband passed from a terrible motorcycle accident. When she came in to make arrangements, she mentioned that she wanted his leather jacket back. Not terribly uncommon for people to want the personal effects back however in this case the jacket was ripped and torn and saturated with blood and had bone fragments embedded in it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035106/87313720/jacket.jpg">

Personal effects from the corners office are usually returned in a sealed bag. The second it was given to her, she took it out and put it on. It smelled terrible. I truly hope she is doing OK now. -sttgal
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035107/87313721/holdinghand.jpg">

10. The funeral home I worked for liked to embalm as soon as possible after death. I had embalmed a man that was dead for less than 30mins-an hour. He was still warm and rigor had not set in yet. I kinda just held his hand for a minute before I got started. -Abisnailyo
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035108/87313722/jewerlystolen.jpg">

11. One of the decedent's grandsons faked a breakdown over the casket. He stole all her jewelry. Didn't take long to figure out and a large brawl broke out. Jewelry was retrieved. Two weeks later grandson turns up needing to be processed and buried. Creepy as hell. -tossaway78701
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035109/87313723/limbs.jpg">

12. Sometimes a fresh corpse will get shaky limbs. -alien-eggs
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035110/87313724/lungs.jpg">

13. Sometimes when people have died, and we turn them over to clean and dress them, they still have air in their lungs and will make grunting noises when moved. Scared the crap out of me, the first time I experienced it. -Kvoller
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035112/87313726/nameatnight.jpg">

14. I had to go to the funeral late one night to get some things ready for my manager to go pick a body up as it was a friend of hers and she just wanted to show up and go. My wife came with me for the drive and I was in the basement while my wife waited up stairs.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035117/87313727/mouth.jpg">

The basement has two parts to it. One is newer and the older section (which we called the catacombs) is where we kept caskets, supplies, etc. I was getting the spare stretcher ready, making sure there’s gloves and other supplies with it when I heard my name called but it came from the catacombs. It was a deeper voice too that made my hair stand on end. I had just been in the catacombs too which made it creepier.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035122/87313728/pizza.jpg">

Wasn’t my wife and there was no one else there as we left before my manager came in. No idea what it was but it definitely freaked me out. -Crucifix1233
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035124/87313729/sitting.jpg">

15. Worked at a mortuary for a few years. We have methods to keep the jaw shut for viewing, otherwise it would gap open due to the angle of the head and neck. During a viewing the device failed and this gentleman’s mouth literally popped open.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035125/87313730/pitchdark.jpg">

The lead embalmer was not on site so I did my best. Ushered the family out of the room and superglued his mouth shut, but he didn’t have teeth and supergluing just his lips did NOT work. It looked as if he was attempting to scream. I had to call in one of our other mortuaries in town and that embalmer used a giant needle and thread to sew his mouth shut from under his chin to his palate. -Maelja

16. I delivered pizza to a crematorium. Dude set down his pizza on a cardboard coffin to get money and I couldn't stop looking at the box on the conveyer leading into the crematorium chamber.

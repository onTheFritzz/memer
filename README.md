## <a href="#link1" id="link0">This Girl’s Brag On Facebook Ended Up Costing Her Family $80,000</a>
1. Most social media users are aware that the things you post can come back to haunt you. They don't disappear, and they're difficult to take back, as anyone who's posted sensitive information or an inflammatory opinion knows.But in the instance of Dana Snay and her family, her bragging on social media (standard behavior for many kids her age) ended up having very real effects that cost her family a staggering amount of money.

See how her questionable judgment became a legal matter below…

2. These are Dana's parents. Her dad was the headmaster at a prestigious prep school (Gulliver Prep) in Miami, and wanted to continue to work until the age of 69, but the school decided not to renew his contract.

3. He sued the school, claiming that the decision was based on his age, which is illegal. The courts agreed and awarded him not only an $80,000 payout, but an additional $60,000 for his attorney and $10,000 in back pay.

4. His daughter, Dana, had attended Gulliver herself and attended Boston College after graduating.

5. She was an accomplished student, but what she did as a result of the settlement demonstrates a certain shortsightedness that many kids have. Only this decision would have effects more profound than most.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202404.jpg">

6. Included in the father's award was a confidentiality clause, which keeps both parties from publicly disclosing the terms of the awards, settlement or transaction. It's pretty standard language that keeps a private dispute from becoming public, even after it's resolved.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202405.jpg">

7. Mr. Snay was aware of the terms of the settlement and abided by them. That included even the general outcome of the dispute, not just dollar amounts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202406.jpg">

8. It's not clear if Dana was familiar with the language in the settlement. One would assume she wasn't, because what she did next was a pretty clear violation of the terms. She took to Facebook and bluntly posted on her wall, "Mama and Papa Snay won the case against Gulliver."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202407.jpg">

9. As though that wasn't flagrant enough, she cracked a joke about the settlement paying for her trip to Europe. Not exactly smart or classy, but kids do these types of things. She posted, "Gulliver is now officially paying for my vacation to Europe this summer. SUCK IT."It didn’t take long for the school’s lawyers to learn that she was discussing things that she was legally bound from discussing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202408.jpg">

10. The court didn't hesitate to reverse the decision after what they deemed to be a clear breach of the terms. The judge of the case wrote, "His daughter then did precisely what the confidentiality agreement was designed to prevent."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202409.jpg">

11. So with a couple innocuous (if not tasteless) online comments, the Snay family was out their entire settlement. Fortunately, he's found new employment, but that surely didn't stop the fallout from his daughter's thoughtless comments from stinging!

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Guy Makes An Amazing Flying Burger Commercial Without CGI Effects</a>
1. The technique is known as "burger drop" and can be made with computer effects...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224900.jpg">

2. ...but this was created without CGI.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224901.gif">

3. Miami photographer Steve Giralt spent a month creating PATRIC - Precision Arduino Timing Relay Imaging Controller that made it possible.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224902.jpg">

4. Creating the effect of burger shaping itself wasn't easy, but Giralt said he had to prove that it's posible without the computer effects that are everywhere these days.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224903.jpg">

5. It took 10 tries to film the flying ingredients, only 4 of them forming a burger, but to hit it with mustard and ketchup was a challenge for 20 tries. Placing the beer without it spilling took 10 tries.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224904.jpg">

6. Steve said he did it for the challenge and the month was too long, he could've done it quicker but he had other assignments.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224905.jpg">

7. A burning passion or too much free time? You decide.

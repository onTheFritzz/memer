## <a href="#link1" id="link0">20 Disturbing Mysteries That Remain Unsolved</a>
1. Honestly the Cape Intruder isn't disturbing just weird as hell. During the night in Cape, Maine in like 2005 people who kept their doors unlocked would wake up to find a man staring at them and he would quickly flee. No people were ever injured and nothing was ever stolen. He just watched people sleep apparently. -whatislife40

2. The Axeman of New Orleans. Guy was murdering people but wrote a letter that he wouldn't kill anyone who played jazz in their home/business. Never caught. -BlueFalconPunch
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112228/87289629/axeman.jpg">

3. West Mesa Bone Collector. Ok this one is extremely creepy- 12 women and girls identified, with the final victim being only 15. Satellite images show the final body was buried in 2005. The police release photos of women that appear to be sleeping or incapacitated saying they are of interest to the case but don’t explain how. -Temporary-Sundae2471

4. The Hinterkaifeck murders always freaked me out. I've read quite a bit about it, and it sounds like it was probably a neighbor. But the creepy part is that the killer was probably living/hiding out in the attic for multiple days beforehand. -TecateLanding
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112250/87289636/hinterkaif.jpg">

5. The disappearance of the Beaumont Children The Beaumont Children are siblings who disappeared in 1966, in Australia. There are still to this day investigations on going to try and find the remains of these children. There have been foundations of sheds and houses dug up.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112231/87289630/BeaumontChildren.jpg">

The children have never been found and the suspect(s) has never been identified. -jnrdingo

6. Technically not unsolved since everyone can guess what happened to her but it’s one of the creepiest IMO. Alissa Turney was a teenager who disappeared in 2001. Her stepfather, Michael Turney, was obsessed with her. He stalked her at work, and put cameras in the vents to spy on her. Michael picked her up from school early on May 17, 2001 and she’s never been seen since. -meyganvibes
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112244/87289633/brandonswanson.jpg">

7. The disappearance of Brandon Swanson. It's a lengthy case so I won't summarize here, but he went missing while on the phone with his parents, his last known words being "Oh shit" before the line went dead. Not a trace of him has ever been found. -bubble0peach
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112223/87289628/alicianavarro.jpg">

8. Alicia Navarro. She went missing, presumably after sneaking out to meet with a man she was talking to on Discord.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112232/87289631/betsyaardmas.jpg">

It's creepy because of how real it is. As a naive girl who met up with guys I befriended online as a teenager, I just cannot stop thinking about how goddamn lucky I was. -meladey
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112237/87289632/brianschaffer.jpg">

9. Murder of Betsy Aardsma. In 1969, Betsy, a student was killed in the stacks of the library at my old college (Penn State) and was found with a singular stab wound on her chest. It wasn’t even late or anything, and while there were many suspects, no one was ever arrested for it. It’s insane how someone could kill a person in broad daylight at a major university, and get away with it. -Rickdaquickk
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112248/87289634/ashadegree.jpg">

10. Brian Shaffer, who went missing from Columbus, Ohio. He was reported missing after a night out. There's security camera footage of him entering a bar, but absolutely no footage of him leaving. Like he went into the bar and just flat out dropped off the face of the earth. The last I knew, he's never been found and nobody knows what happened to him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112249/87289635/flight370.jpg">

The bar was on a second floor at that time with only one public entrance/exit. The police extensively reviewed all the security camera footage. Brian and everyone else who was there that night was seen on camera entering the bar. Everyone, except for Brian, who was at the bar that night was seen on camera leaving the bar. Which would nix any theories that he left wearing different clothes/disguised as someone else/mixed in with a crowd. -RedRose_812
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112256/87289639/missybevers.jpg">

11. Asha Degree. There’s so many weird things about the case to me. She went missing on her parent’s anniversary, she ran into the woods when approached, and likely left home in her pajamas. It feels like she left on her own, I just can’t begin to imagine why. -chesterlola2014
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112300/87289640/kyronhorman.jpg">

12. Flight 370 Malaysia Airlines. Disappeared without a trace. -ignaciodib
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112251/87289638/iowapaperboys.jpg">

13. Missy Bevers. A suspect in full SWAT armor breaks into a church and smashes windows and breaks opens doors with a hammer, looking for a local fitness instructor. They then find and beat her to death before getting away.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112312/87289646/zebbquinn.jpg">

There is high quality surveillance video of both them and their car, but investigators couldn't make out the license plate. There has been a suspect who was cleared because of an alibi, and there's been no recent updates. -wedoabitoftrolling
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112300/87289641/sodder.png">

14. Kyron Horman. I feel like somebody knows something that will blow the case wide open but to this day nobody knows where he went or what happened to him. There are some solid theories out there but it’ll always be a mystery until we get an official answer. -candycrunch1
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112304/87289643/theislandofeileanmor.jpg">

15. In the early 80s, all within 18 months of each other, three paperboys in the Des Moines, IA area all went missing during their morning route. The cases have never been solved. There are theories an ex-employee who was a creeper kidnapped them, and even a lone wolf type situation. It's a bizarre case that has baffled Iowa for years. -deleted
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112306/87289644/yogurtshop.jpg">

16. The disappearance of Zebb Quinn. He was 18 years old when he went missing in 2000. He was working his shift at a local Walmart and afterwards wanted to look at a new car with a colleague, when he allegedly received a call that made him take off frantically. After that he was never seen again.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">20 Greatest Historic Falls from Grace</a>
1. Joe Paterno. He basically ran State College and 100% could’ve and should’ve done more after his reporting went nowhere. Instead, he chose to not make more noise and let it go. -c-williams88
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112614/87309169/paterno.jpg">

2. Benedict Arnold. Hero general of the American Revolution. One of George Washington's best assets. Felt slighted and overlooked by his contemporaries. Switched sides to the British, made no difference to the war effort. Died in disgrace in England. His name is now a synonym for traitor. -GonnaGoFar
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112511/87309155/benarn.jpg">

3. Fred Phelps. Started his career as a celebrated civil rights lawyer in Kansas. Followed up Brown vs Board of Education 20 years later and ended up forcing them to implement more fair educational conditions for students of color.

Went on to form the Westboro Baptist Church which became one of the most despicable hate groups in the US. Notorious for their homophobia and protesting at military funerals. -MercutioMan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112517/87309157/bernie.jpg">

4. Bernie Madoff. His entire family thought he was some rich finance guy. Then they find out not only do they have nothing, but their dad stole (and destroyed) more money than just about any individual in the history of the world. Bernie and his wife tried to commit suicide, and one of his sons was successful in doing so. -Radrezzz
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112601/87309166/mary1.jpg">

5. Mary I of England came to my mind first. Overcame huge threats & obstacles to her right to the throne … because she had the support and love of the people. She defeated the attempted coup, ascended to the throne, showed mercy to the traitors, etc.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112529/87309160/hansie.jpg">

Then promptly married an unpopular foreigner and tried to force everyone to follow her religion. If they didn’t, they got burned alive. -Adjectivenounnumb

6. Hansie Cronje. Post Apartheid cricket captain in South Africa. He united a divided nation through so many sports victories. In 2000 however, he was found guilty of match fixing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112533/87309161/jeffreyjones.jpg">

7. Fritz Haber. A German Chemist and Nobel prize winner, he helped pioneer the Haber process for synthesizing Ammonia. This is important, because it was a key ingredient in artificial fertiliser. He has saved countless lives from hunger. Untold millions. Unlocking a piece of science that changed the face of organic chemistry forever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112544/87309163/henry8.jpg">

Then came the first world war. If he were a sorcerer, it would be as if he turned to the darkest of arts. After saving the world, and gifting such an innovation to humanity, he then turned his mind to destroying it. He invented chemical warfare. -Dawningrider
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112546/87309164/lindbergh.jpg">

8. Jeffrey Jones. In 2002, Jones was arrested for possession of child pornography and accused by a 17-year-old boy of solicitation to pose for nude photographs. He pleaded no contest to a charge of soliciting a minor, as the accuser was 14 when the offense first occurred. -MaeToMontreal

9. Aaron Burr. He was Vice President of the United States when he shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. The duel killed Burr's political career—he was dropped from Thomas Jefferson's ticket in the 1804 election, and he couldn't even win an election for governor of New York. -gerhudire
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112616/87309171/rudy.jpg">

10. Henry VIII has to be up there. He was a famously handsome, pious, and noble young king, very in love with Katherine when they were married, and over time he became the wife-killing tyrant we know today. -SmunkTheLesser
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112603/87309167/philspector.jpg">

11. Charles Lindbergh deserves to be in the conversation. After making the historic first solo transatlantic flight, and gaining the sympathy of many after the kidnapping and murder of his son, he promoted American neutrality in WWII. Though he reversed his stance after the attack on Pearl Harbor, many had already branded him a Nazi sympathizer. -itto_02

13. Rudy Giuliani. After the attacks of 9/11 he brought NYC together as mayor was on SNL and threw out the first pitch at Yankee stadium was really well liked by everyone.

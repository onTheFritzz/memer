## <a href="#link6" id="link5">20 Cool Things People Found While Using Metal Detectors</a>
1. I've found a meteorite in Kansas. There is an area outside of Greensburg that is known to have had a meteor explode in the air before hitting the earth and dozens of smaller fragments are scattered over many miles. They are very deep and a lot of work to dig up, but my dad and I dug a 7 foot hole and extracted a nearly 30 pound stony-iron pallasite meteorite, which is worth nearly $2,000 a pound.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257740.jpg">

2. My buddy and I bought metal detectors during lockdown and went to the local lake to hunt. I s**t you not he found a silver grill. Not a barbeque, a set of silver teeth in the sand of the local beach. We quit metal detecting right then and there lol
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257750.jpg">

3. Literally only did it once with a friend when I was a teenager at a beach with a friend (he and his dad were really into it). We found a $20k watch in 1995 dollars. Wasn’t a Rolex, but can’t remember the maker. We took it to a jeweler who made a few calls and found out it was in a registry and the owner was called. He was elated as it was a gift from his wife. He sent us each a check for $1,000. The jeweler gave us each a bitchin fake gold chain on the spot. Jean shorts and high tops need the perfect neck accessory and we got it!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257739.jpg">

4. I have found quite a few musketballs! Someone clearly did lots of shooting on our land back in the day
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257753.jpg">

5. Some German metal detecting / WWII enthusiasts actually found pieces of my grandfather’s B-24 Liberator that he was shot down in. They were able to ID the plane by its serial numbers. Miraculously, my uncle was on the same forum they were posting their finds on and connected. They sent my grandfather the pieces of his plane.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257741.jpg">

6. Not my thing, but my brother was detecting just downstream from a popular swimming hole on the American River in California a couple of years ago, looking for dropped watches, phones, go pros, etc. Got a hit, flipped a rock, and found an 11.5-ounce gold nugget underneath. Miners tore the hell out of those rivers back in the 1849 Gold Rush, and amateurs have been panning it ever since, so it was pretty freaking incredible to find something that big.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257743.jpg">

7. Bit of a cheat as was working a site on a uni course in Northern England. Discovered the end of a Roman Dagger and a relatively intact boot replete with nails. Also found a beautiful fragment of a glass bangle; beautiful turquoise blue glass with a bright yellow wave pattern painted on it. Fellow student found and urn full of silver coins. Jammy git.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257742.jpg">

8. Work on a farm - a metal detector found a coin under a tree which was 600 years old and in almost perfect condition- as if it had fallen out of someone's pocket as they sat and had lunch after planting the tree.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257744.jpg">

9. Found an old roman coin, they're are a ton of them so not very valuable, but as someone who loves roman history its really cool
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257745.jpg">

10. 15 years ago, me and my siblings found a bomb from World War II in the Belgian Ardennes, using a $30 toy metal detector.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257746.jpg">

I remember walking off-road in the woods for hours until we found a spot that looked like nobody has been there in ages. We quickly found a couple of bullets and, while I was inspecting the bullets, my younger brother age 9 saw something sticking out of the dirt.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257747.jpg">

At first, we thought it was a rusty metal can, but when he pulled it out, it took us a moment to realize that he was holding a bomb. We didn’t know whether it was still intact so I instructed him to slowly put it down in a way that it could not roll off the hill and hit something.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257748.jpg">

We didn’t have any mobile phones so we rushed to the nearest road which we followed to get to a village to get help. We marked the trees so we would remember where we had hidden the bomb.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257749.jpg">

When we arrived at the village, we explained what happened. Luckily, they believed our story and called the local police. When he arrived, we couldn’t understand a word he said (he was speaking French, we only spoke Dutch) — but eventually he would follow us deep into the woods.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257751.jpg">

When we arrived, the bomb was luckily still there, and after an inspection by the police officer we were instructed to leave as apparently it was too dangerous and had to be picked up by the bomb squad — but not before we snapped a picture for the local press, posing with the bomb next to us. I still have that picture.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257752.jpg">

11. I found a blacksmith’s shop in the middle of a farmers field. I was detecting for a historical society and their local expert told me to detect a certain spot that he calculated where the blacksmith shop would be. I did a 10x10 foot area with only finding small pieces of slag. I wasn’t convinced that the shop was there, but the expert wouldn’t have it. While everyone took a break at noon. I started a spiral pattern going farther and farther from his calculations. About 30 minutes later and 100 feet away, I got good strong signals and large slag pieces. I even found a single clay brick. One of the society members started an excavation at my spot. They eventually hit the corner of the shops foundation. They found a hammer and tools for the anvil and the rest of the blacksmith shop.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257754.jpg">

12. A few weeks ago I was driving on a country road near my house. There was a car pulled over to the side and a young couple was walking around obviously looking for something. I stopped and asked if they needed help. The girl told me, "We were arguing and I threw a ring out of the window." Seeing the guy was beyond pissed, I told them good luck and I drove off. A few days later I got to thinking to borrow a metal detector from a friend who is into that. Went back and searched for about an hour, getting ready to call it quits when I found the ring. Sadly, I have no idea who the couple was and just hope they are OK now.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257755.jpg">

13. I took a metal detector to my grandparents’ garden when I was 10 and found some Civil War canister shot. Goddamned if it didn’t get lost in a move a few years later. Never found anything as cool as that since then.

To make up for that, I spent the next ten years poring over war-era battle maps showing the positions of each regiment and battery over the course of a particular major battle that basically crisscrossed the whole area, comparing with modern topo maps, doing serious deep dives into primary sources, etc. Eventually, I figured out the exact hill the grapeshot had likely been fired from, and the side that fired it.

I’m glad I got to experience finding it, at least, even though it got lost. It played a big role in my turning into a big history nerd early on.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257738.jpg">

14. I used to live near the railroad tracks near an airport and an old industrial area. They used to have a local station for the workers to shuttle into the area (late 1800's, early 1900's). They eventually tore down the station in the 30's/40's when the highways got built nearby.
My dad used to take me with metal detectors and we would find railroad spikes, pocket watches, wrist watches, old silver
​dollars and other coins. Best haul by far was a gold locket with a picture of someone's wife/girlfriend ensribed "All My Love, Annie". It wasn't the prettiest locket, but you bet your bottom dollar someone was kicking themselves for losing that precious treasure.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257756.jpg">

15. Usually just found lose change people lost at the beach. However, I did have to go find a diamond ring once. Wife of a friend who was currently deployed CLAIMS she lost it while at the beach with her GIRLFRIENDS. It took me a day, but I was able to find it. She was appreciative. It wasn't until he got back that I found out that she lost it because she was taking it off while dating other men. I hated her ever since for playing me like that.

10. Eduard Bloch, the Jewish physician of the Hitler family in his office c. 1938. Bloch was later called a ‘noble Jew’ by Hitler and stood under his personal protection.

This was his family physician growing up. Hitler had siblings, and parents. This doctor did all he could while they were poor, and when Hitler’s mother had cancer. He kindly gave them discounts on medicine, and apparently didn’t charge them when they really needed it. He was supposedly quite fond of the family in general, and when the Holocaust and Nazi rise occurred, Dr Bloch and his wife were protected, and admitted to leave the country without harassment, even allowed to sell their home at a normal price. Dr Bloch really tried to help Hitler’s mother during her illness, and Hitler really appreciated it, even sent the guy flowers at Christmas.
When Dr Bloch wrote to Hitler during the Anschluss, Hitler immediately responded by sending the Gestapo to make sure no harm came to the Blochs.

14. Two women collect the remains of a dead horse for food, Siege of Leningrad, 1941.

The 872-day Siege of Leningrad, Russia, resulted from the failure of the German Army Group North to capture Leningrad in the Eastern Front of World War II. The siege lasted from September 8, 1941 to January 27, 1944 and was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history, causing considerable devastation to the city of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The total number of human losses during the 29 months of the siege of Leningrad is estimated as 1.5 million, both civilian and military. Only 700,000 people were left alive of a 3.5 million pre-war population. Among them were soldiers, workers, surviving children and women. Of the 700,000 survivors, about 300,000 were soldiers who came from other parts of the country to help in the besieged city.

15. Saigon execution: Murder of a Vietcong by Saigon Police Chief, 1968.

After Nguyen Ngoc Loan raised his sidearm and shot Vietcong operative Nguyen Van Lem in the head he walked over to the reporters and told them that: “These guys kill a lot of our people, and I think Buddha will forgive me”. Captured on NBC TV cameras and by AP photographer Eddie Adams, the picture and film footage flashed around the world and quickly became a symbol of the Vietnam War’s brutality. Eddie Adams’ picture was especially striking, as the moment frozen is one almost at the instant of death. 
For all the image’s political impact, though, the situation wasn’t as black-and-white as it’s rendered. What Adams’ photograph doesn’t reveal is that the man being shot (named Nguyen Van Lem) was the captain of a Vietcong “revenge squad” that had executed dozens of unarmed civilians earlier the same day.

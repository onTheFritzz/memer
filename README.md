## <a href="#link1" id="link0">24 Facts That Could Save Your Life</a>
1. If you are in a foreign country and need to call for help, but don't know the emergency number, call 112. It's the international emergency number and will automatically connect you to the nearest help line.

2. If you ever feel like someone is following your car take four right turns and eventually it will make a circle. If they are still behind you that means they are following you. Don't drive home, just call the police and drive to the police station.

3. If a tornado looks like it's not moving, it's actually moving towards you.

4. If a service dog ever approaches you without its owner, follow them and do it quickly because potentially you can save someone else's life.

5. If someone ever tries to grab you, scratch them. Their DNA will now be in your nails.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312637.jpg">

6. If you're ever buried in an avalanche, spit. Your saliva will follow the gravity and you can simply dig the opposite way.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312638.jpg">

7. If you ever wake up in the middle of the night to the smell of gas, do NOT turn on the light. A spark from a light switch could blow up the entire house.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312639.jpg">

8. If you accidentally disturb a beehive or wasp nest, do not run for the water. They'll wait for you to resurface and continue stinging you. Just run fast and as far as you can, because eventually, they will stop following you.

9. The more colorful and vivid the animal is the more likely it's poisonous and you probably shouldn't eat it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312641.jpg">

10. Everyone hates red eyes in photos. But if your pupils reflect white in a picture, it could be a sign that something is seriously wrong with your eyes, such as cataract, retina problems, or even eye cancer.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312642.jpg">

11. If you are ever being chased by a polar bear get completely naked and drop your clothes on the ground as you run away. Polar bears have really bad ADD and will firmly inspect your clothes before chasing you again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312643.jpg">

12. If someone gets stabbed, do not take the knife out. It acts as a plug to the hole and prevents blood loss. Apply pressure to the wound and call the police.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312644.jpg">

13. Wolves will only attack you if they can intimidate you into running away from them. Standing your ground against a wolf pack will be terrifying but eventually, they will leave you alone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312645.jpg">

14. The machine that sets the pins at the bowling alley is extremely dangerous. So if you slide into the pins as a joke, there is a very good chance that you will be crushed to death.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312646.jpg">

15. If you ever for some reason ingest windshield wiper fluid or anti-freeze, drink large amounts of vodka to keep it from shredding your kidneys to give you time to get to the hospital.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312647.jpg">

16. If you ever get carjacked and they tell you to drive, crash the car into the nearby road or intersection. Most likely they won't be wearing their seatbelts. So when you crash the car they will get injured and you can take this chance to get out of the car and run like hell.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312648.jpg">

17. If your house smells like fish for absolutely no reason, 9 times out of 10 it means that there is an electrical fire.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312633.jpg">

18. Lying flat on your back is the best way to survive a falling elevator.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312649.jpg">

19. If you ever fall off of the edge of the subway platform and onto the tracks don't waste your time trying crawl back up. There is a crawl space built to go underneath in case this happens.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312650.jpg">

20. If a deer is running across the road it's better to hit it than swerve and run into a ditch. If there is a moose in the middle of the road swerve and run into a ditch. Hitting a moose is like running into a brick wall.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312651.jpg">

21. Have you ever been told that if an alligator is chasing you that you should run in a zigzag? Well, contrary to popular belief, alligators actually aren't stupid and they can run up to 35 miles per hour. So just run straight and run like hell.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312652.jpg">

22. You can always dial 911 if you have no bars because, in an emergency, your phone will connect to any nearby cell tower as long as it has a battery in it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312653.jpg">

23. If you ever get stuffed in the back of a trunk disconnect the brake light wires so when the cop pulls them over you can kick the door so people know you are there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312654.jpg">

24. If you ever need to escape a moving car do not jump out, put one foot down and take a step. This will significantly reduce your speed and will have a much greater chance of surviving the fall.

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">10 Of The Most Paused Scenes In Movie History</a>
1. In ‘Basic Instinct,’ Sharon Stone’s character Catherine Tramell uses her sex appeal to distract the police interrogating her. A simple crossing of her legs leaves all the officers staring and baffled. Boobs or not, you can’t say you didn’t hit pause on that scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177066.jpg">

2. During the pterodactyl attack scene in ‘Jurassic World,’ you may have missed the famous Jimmy Buffett grabbing a few margaritas and running for cover. After this scene his character might not be wastin’ away again in Margaritaville.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177067.jpg">

3. Who doesn’t remember the famous scene in ‘Fast Times at Ridgemont High’ that made the 80’s amazing? In a daydream, Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) pictures Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) getting out of the pool in a red bikini and slowly taking off her top. It may have been a daydream in the film but it was very real for pre-teens everywhere.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177068.jpg">

4. The first ‘Iron Man’ held back on hidden easter eggs, but there’s one that got people excited. Pepper walks in on Tony having the Iron Man suit removed and under Tony’s right arm you can see a prototype of Captain America’s shield sitting on the table.

5. Probably one of the most notable movie mishaps happens in ‘Star Wars: A New Hope’ when one clumsy Storm Trooper hits his head walking through a doorway.

6. With Jones pointing a rocket launcher at Dr. René Belloq (Paul Freeman) in ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,’ it may be hard to notice that a fly lands on Belloq’s face and makes its way into his mouth. The scene was never cut and made it into the finished film.

7. It’s no secret that Margot Robbie is a beautifully hypnotic woman. In ‘Wolf of Wall Street,’ she plays Jordan Belfort’s smoke show of a wife, Naomi. In one scene the two get into an argument and Naomi uses her fiery good looks against Jordan. Don’t lie I know you were biting your knuckles too!

8. When the fight between Superman and General Zod makes its way to space, they smash into a satellite. You can see the Wayne Enterprises logo plastered on the side, meaning that Batman and Superman existed in the same world.

9. ‘Fight Club’ was full of little easter eggs here and there but some were too quick to notice without hitting pause. Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) appears for a single frame a few times during the first act. This is your life and it’s ending one minute at a time so don’t miss these quick moments that make ‘Fight Club’ the amazing film it is.

10. In ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens,’ Luke Skywalker appears only a single scene in the film. Some people say that Luke is standing next to a gravestone of someone special where others say it’s just an oddly shaped stone.

12. In 1945, the director of the Los Alamos Lab during the Manhattan Project, Robert Oppenheimer, bet ten dollars against a colleague's entire month's pay that the bomb would not work at all. The actual result was 21 kilotons, more than 4 times as much as had been predicted by most at Los Alamos.

24. Richard Feynman, a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, was hounded by the FBI until he sent them a memo to leave him alone as he’d helped build the atomic bomb. When J. Edgar Hoover found out about it, he also sent out a memo telling them not to pursue Feynman unless told otherwise.

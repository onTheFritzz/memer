## <a href="#link10" id="link9">20 Common Sayings That are Completely False</a>
1. "‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’ Not necessarily. There are a lot of things that won’t kill you, but they’ll probably mess you up a lot and make you feel very weak."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231602.jpg">

2. "Good things come to those who wait."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231601.jpg">

3. "Out of sight, out of mind." Ever lost track of a spider?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231600.jpg">

4. "Absence makes the heart grow fonder.” BUT THEN ALSO, “out of sight, out of mind.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231603.jpg">

5. "Opposites attract."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231604.jpg">

6. "Time heals all wounds."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231606.jpg">

7. “If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.” This is like 98% BS. Generally, turning your hobbies or passions into a job just makes you hate things you once loved. Being forced  to do anything makes it significantly less fun. I absolutely despise when someone tells me to do something I wanted to anyway.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231609.jpg">

8. "Money is the root of all evil. The LOVE of money is the root of all evil."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231607.jpg">

9. "The early bird gets the worm." No, the early bird gets stuck waiting in line with everyone else who decided to be the early bird, as well.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231608.jpg">

10. “Money doesn’t buy happiness.” Yes. Yes it does.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231610.jpg">

11. "If a bird poops on your head it's good luck." Sure Dan, tell that to the 3 birds last week that took aiming sessions at my head!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231611.jpg">

12. "Lightning never strikes the same place twice."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231605.jpg">

13. "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me." Clearly invented by someone who had never heard of emotional trauma. Words don't have to be insults to break someone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231612.jpg">

14. "What goes around comes around." BS. I've seen people be jerks my entire life and they never got what should have come around to them."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231598.jpg">

15. "The customer is always right. They miss a part that says 'in terms of taste.' Basically it means what's trending. If anyone has worked in customer service you will know that the customer is almost always wrong.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231613.jpg">

16. "When I was in my 20s, my weight used to be 400 pounds. When I reached 180 a few years ago, an absurd number of doors started to open. Everything was suddenly easy for me; people were suddenly nicer to me, and I had no trouble finding work. Looks are important."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231599.jpg">

17. "He who smelt it dealt it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231596.jpg">

18. "Cheaters never win."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231597.jpg">

19. "Rules are meant to be broken." They were made for literally the opposite.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231614.jpg">

20. "You can be whatever you want to be. Sorry to break it to you kid, but reality don't work that way."

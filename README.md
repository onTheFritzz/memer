2. Disney's Aladdin was originally supposed to be set in Baghdad, but John Musker and Ron Clements were forced to change it due to the outbreak of the Gulf War. So, they took letters and did a jumbled anagram and came up with Agrabah.

3. During the Gulf War, the U.S. dropped a 6,800 kg BLU-82 bomb to conduct psychological warfare against Iraqi troops. A British SAS unit that witnessed the explosion assumed the U.S. had used a nuclear weapon and radioed back to their headquarters, "Sir, the blokes have just nuked Kuwait!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87227842.png">

4. The first human surrender to a robot occurred in the 1991 Gulf War. The US used UAVs (drone robots) to find artillery targets. Iraqi soldiers realized that the UAVs often preceded an attack strike. A Pioneer RQ-2A UAV flew over some soldiers who then raised white flags to surrender to the robot.

12. During the Gulf War when American forces were faced with extensive trenches of Iraqi soldiers they, "opted to use anti-mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87227851.jpg">

13. In 1990, Nayirah al-Ṣabaḥ, daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the US, gave a false testimony which galvanized support for the first Persian Gulf War.

20. Saddam Hussein's regime genocided an entire race of 500,000 people known as the "Marsh Arabs" after the Persian Gulf War by literally destroying the environment that their entire civilization was built upon, building 32 dams to turn their homes and farms into deserts.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">Girl Running From The Law Insists Cops Use Better Mugshot of Her</a>
1. Amy Sharp is an 18-year-old girl from Australia, who sadly has found herself on the wrong side of the law. After a 3-week stint at a correctional facility in Sydney last week, Amy escaped and quickly discovered the ‘wanted’ photos of herself were less than flattering. What’s a young girl to do in crisis? She took action, and through her own Facebook account she requested that the cops replace her current mugshot with something a little more appropriate.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85120327.jpg">

2. This is the photo police released of Amy and that the press was running with.
It simply won’t do.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85120328.jpg">

3. Amy provided the media & cops with a less harsh alternative photo. Mind you, she was a fugitive at time she decided to post this.

4. The proper photo Amy really thought she deserved
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85120330.jpg">

5. Well, as you might’ve expected, Amy’s callout helped cops pinpoint her exact location and shortly after they were able to recapture the little troublemaker once again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85120331.jpg">

6. And of course, after Amy became an internet sensation overnight, the public had to weigh in with a little commentary of their own, as is par for the course.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715027.jpg">

## <a href="#link1" id="link0">Japanese Store Unveils A 1.8 Million Dollar Gold Christmas Tree</a>
1. The gold Christmas tree went on sale after being unveiled at a jewellery store in downtown Tokyo yesterday. The 42 pound tree is decorated with gold wire and stands 6.6 feet high at the Ginza Tanaka store. The tree gained world wide attention and immediately became a tourist attraction.

2. The jewelry store in the Japanese capital has celebrated its 90th anniversary with this sparkling tree- “We made this gold Christmas tree hoping it will remind of bright and shiny future like gold that wipes out gloomy news” said store manager Takahiro Ito.

3. If you find this weird you will be shocked to know almost everyone in Japan goes to KFC for Christmas and it's a tradition there; So a golden tree worth almost 2 million dollars doesn't seem that crazy in comparison.

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">15 Times Actors and Actresses Were NOT Faking Their Sex Scenes </a>
1. In Little Ashes, Twilight star Robert Pattinson has a scene where he pleasures himself. Many people found his performance to be a little too convincing. Pattinson would later reveal he absolutely did the deed just below camera saying there was no way he could properly portray the scene without actually following through with the act.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191016.jpg">

2. In Lie With Me, Eric Balfour and Lauren Lee Smith made no qualms about their explicit, real sex and never even denied it. That would essentially make this a porn, no?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191017.jpg">

3. I am sure this comes as a huge shocker, but there are rumors that much of the sex in this film did in fact actually happen. The only participants to actually come clean, however, are Shia Labeouf and Stacy Martin. Martin has since back tracked and said it didn’t actually happen, but knowing Lars Von Trier, I tend to side with debauchery.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191018.jpg">

4. It was the wild 70’s, so this may be even less surprising than the last, but some of the sex and fellatio scenes in this movie really took place. Maybe most shocking is that the actors who participated, Helen Mirren and Malcolm McDowell, turned out to be highly respected actors. And Mirren is an absolute fox.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191019.jpg">

5. Here’s that Lars Von Trier guy again. Surprise surprise. His last movie on this list dealt with sexual addiction, while this one is more about relationships, but the result is still the same. Explicit and real sex. Copious amounts. All of the intercourse and masturbation is real, with the film’s producers saying, “Without the sex scenes, the film’s drama would fall apart.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191020.jpg">

6. The Brown Bunny has perhaps the most well-known non-simulated sex scene. In this film, Chloe Sevigny gives co-star and Director (wonder who did the casting for this?) oral sex all on camera. No body doubles. No trick dick. This is the real deal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191021.jpg">

7. Perhaps the most influential Blaxploitation film, is more regularly remembered for the very authentic and graphic sex scenes. Of course, they look real because they are. According to Melvin Van Peebles, he even got the STD to prove it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191022.jpg">

8. Director John Waters may be almost as famous as Von Trier for his propensity to push the envelope and stir controversy. In Pink Flamingos, over-the-top drag queen Divine gives completely authentic oral sex to her son… This comes after she eats dog shit. Must see?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191023.jpg">

9. Perhaps the only tandem to be more infamous than famous for their real sex scene, Kieran O’Brien and Margo Stilley admitted to really doing the duty, even after being voted one of the worst sex scenes of all time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191024.jpg">

10. Perhaps it’s not too surprising that the French, known to push the envelope artistically, would have a film make this list. Baise-moi is a film about rape-revenge featuring some brutal unsimulated sex.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191025.jpg">

11. Over four decades ago, Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie engaged in one of the hottest damn sex scenes ever on film. For the day and age it was shot, it destroyed the boundaries of main stream Hollywood sex scenes. Since then, Christie has all but confirmed the rumors that their red hot on film action, was the real deal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191026.jpg">

12. In the HBO series, Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer have some steamy as hell sex scenes. Many, including people on the sets have said they were definitely not faking it, but the couple have never confirmed. Ooooh Sookie Sookie!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191027.jpg">

13. All kinds of rumors came out about Sienna Miller’s smoking hot sex scene with Hayden Christensen in Factory Girl. Many people accused and claimed the scene was in fact real. Miller has denied it from day one, saying she’s just that good of an actress, but I think we all know that’s not true. I am going to choose to believe she’s a dirty dirty girl and got nasty on camera. For journalistic reasons.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191028.jpg">

14. On this track by The Notorious B.I.G. there is background noise that sounds a little too much like Biggie getting a hummer. Puff Daddy later confirmed in a interview that you’re hearing exactly what you think you are.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191029.jpg">

15. In the video for Marilyn Manson’s Heart Shaped Glasses, the singer engages in some seriously convincing sex with then girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood. Neither star has confirmed it was the real deal, but Manson is on record saying Wood got paid the most money anyone ever has for appearing in a music video for a reason…

5. World’s Largest Floating Solar Farm.

A floating solar farm is more expensive to build than one on land, because it must be designed to withstand salt and humidity from water. But it has advantages: It can be built on otherwise unused surface. It works more efficiently, because the presence of water cools the panels as they generate electricity. It can mitigate evaporation of water, keeping the lake full for longer.

The stainless steel statue, by South Dakota artist laureate Dale Lamphere, depicts an Indigenous woman in Plains-style dress receiving a star quilt. The sculpture honors the culture of the Lakota and Dakota peoples who are indigenous to South Dakota.
The statue boldly proclaims that South Dakota’s Native cultures are alive, standing with dignity.
When interviewed after the dedication, Lamphere said “It’s been well received by the Native community, and by visitors from all over the country. My hope over time is it really gets people to think about the beauty of the native cultures.”

11. US Marine returns a flag he took from a fallen Japanese soldier during WWII to the soldier’s family. They had never received any of his remains or belongings until that moment.

Marvin Strombo, who had taken the calligraphy-covered Japanese flag from a dead soldier at a World War II island battlefield 73 years ago, returned it Tuesday to the family of Sadao Yasue. They had never gotten his body or — until that moment — anything else of his.
Yasue and Tatsuya’s sister Sayoko Furuta, 93, sitting in her wheelchair, covered her face with both hands and wept silently as Tatsuya placed the flag on her lap. Strombo reached out and gently rubbed her shoulder.
‘‘I was so happy that I returned the flag,’’ Strombo said. ‘‘I can see how much the flag meant to her. That almost made me cry … It meant everything in the world to her.’’
The flag’s white background is filled with signatures of 180 friends and neighbors in this tea-growing mountain village of Higashishirakawa, wishing Yasue’s safe return. The signatures helped Strombo find its rightful owners.
The smell of the flag immediately brought back childhood memories. ‘‘It smelled like my good old big brother, and it smelled like our mother’s home cooking we ate together,’’ Tatsuya Yasue said. ‘‘The flag will be our treasure.’’

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Pulitzer Prize Winning Photographs: Part Two</a>
1. 1986:  Tom Gralish – “Philadelphia’s Homeless.”  In winter of 1985 Gralish visited the city’s homeless and encountered Walter.  “I like any kind of food,” said Walter.  Whatever’s there.  Hotdog one day, the next Chinese food, roast beef sandwich…”
Walter lives on a sidewalk heating grate and is one of those guys who is hard to reach because he talks to himself and rants to people on the street.  Everyone knows him; people who live and work in the neighborhood give him change.  Eventually, Walter allowed Gralish to photograph him.  “People like it when you pay attention to them.  These guys had disdain for society and the rules, that’s why they objected to the shelters.  They saw themselves as the last free men.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/677914/85345810.jpg">

2. 1987:  David C. Peterson – “American Farmers.”  For photographs depicting the shattered dreams of American farmers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/677914/85345811.jpg">

3. 1988:  Scott Shaw – “Baby Jessica.”  October 14, 1987: Left alone briefly in her aunt’s Midland, Texas, backyard while her mother went inside to answer the phone, 18-month-old Jessica McClure fell into an abandoned 22-foot-deep well.
Firemen, paramedics, and a cadre of drillers struggled to reach her as the town of Midland immediately united for the mission. A fledgling CNN picked up local TV station KMID’s video feed of Baby Jessica’s rescue, and the story became the first live round-the-clock news event, garnering an immense worldwide audience.
Three days into the rescue, paramedic Robert O’Donnell (who was claustrophobic) wriggled down a parallel shaft dug 28 feet down and through a tunnel to come up under Baby Jessica. But her leg, pinned above her head, held  her firmly in place, and O’Donnell couldn’t budge her. Inch by inch, with some patience and K-Y Jelly slathered over the well walls, O’Donnell pulled Jessica free. He handed her to a fireman who wrapped her onto a board and lifted her safely back up into the world, 58 hours after her fall.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/677914/85345812.jpg">

4. 1989:  Ron Olshwanger – “Rescue Attempt.”  Olshwanger captured an image of St Louis firefighter Adam Long giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the limp form of 2 year old Patricia Pettus as he rushed her from a burning apartment on Dec 30, 1988.
The next day, as she clung to life at St. Louis Children's Hospital, the photo ran on the front page of the Post-Dispatch. Before long, it was published in newspapers worldwide, and chronicled a moment that would change fire safety standards around the world.
Six days after the fire, Patricia died. The following spring, Olshwanger was presented the prestigious Pulitzer Prize for spot news photography.
As for Long, the incident branded him a hero — he received a Medal of Honor — though he didn't feel very heroic. "For about a year, I second-guessed myself: 'Did I really do all that I could have done?'" Long said.
The two men grieved when she died. They attended her funeral together.
And as difficult as it was to accept her loss, each found meaning in her death.
"The little girl did not die in vain," said Olshwanger, who said he still receives requests for copies of the photo. "To me, she is a hero because people are going out and buying smoke detectors because of what they see in that photo."
The fire also sparked a friendship between Olshwanger and Long that has remained strong for over 20 years.

8. 1994:  Kevin Carter – “Vulture and Child.”  Carter traveled to Sudan to cover the relentless East African famine.  He found people so weakened by hunger that they were dying at the rate of 20 per hour.
Carter found a young girl trying to make her way to a feeding station and readied his camera.  Suddenly, a vulture landed nearby.  Carter took the photo before chasing the bird away.  Afterward, he sat under a tree and cried.
The picture ran in newspapers worldwide, and Carter received outraged letters and angry phone calls demanding to know why he didn’t pick up the child.  But journalists in Sudan were told not to touch the famine victims because of the risk of disease transmission.  This was no comfort to Carter, who later told a friend, “I’m really, really sorry I didn’t pick the child up.”  The controversy and other personal problems overwhelmed him.  On July 16, 1994, police found Carter dead in an apartment of an apparent suicide.  He was 33 years old.

9. 1995:  Carol Guzy – “Crisis in Haiti.”  On Dec 16, 1990, Bertrand Aristide won Haiti’s first free presidential election.  Less than a year later he was deposed and sent into exile.  The U.S. imposed a trade embargo and thousands of Haitians fled. 
In September 1994, U.S. Troops landed in Haiti to help return Aristide to power.  In Port-Au-Prince there was a joyous democracy march.  Then someone threw a grenade into the crowd.  People were killed and wounded.  There was shooting, but no one could figure out where it was coming from.  During the chaos, Guzy captured the above image showing a man on the ground with his arm raised.  The crowd thought he had thrown the grenade and were trying to attack him.  Two U.S. Troops were trying to protect him.

Paseka got too close to the swollen creek that ran past the Bennet Valley Apartment Complex where she lived, and fell in.  Wells was able to secure a safety harness around Paseka who was then pulled to safety.

11. 1998:  Martha Rial – “Trek of Tears: An African Journey.”  The line of refugees reaches to the horizon, victims of the centuries old warfare between Africa’s Hutu and Tutsi tribes.  Most are women and children.  Many are hungry.
Said Rial: “The stream of refuges you see here had been walking for almost 24 hours.  The previous evening they heard word that the Tanzanian government was going to force them to leave.  They were trying to flee, to go deeper into the bush.  They were forced back by the troops into Rwanda.  the group is led by a handful of militia guys.  Men who are the leaders in the communities.  They may or may not be wanted for genocide.”

In Nairobi alone more than 200 people were killed and about 4,000 wounded.  The Pulizter was awarded for this portfolio showing both the horror and humanity triggered by the bombings.

14. 2001:  Alan Diaz – “The Taking of Elian.”  U.S. federal agents burst through the door of a Miami home on April 22, 2000, as they seize a Cuban boy named Elian Gonzalez.  Elian was hiding in a closet with Donato Dalrymple, one of two men who had rescued him from a raft off the Florida coast months earlier.  Elian’s U.S. based relatives lost a bitter legal battle with U.S. officials to prevent Elian from being returned to his father in Cuba.  The Gonzalez family allowed photographer Alan Diaz to wait for the raid with Dalrymple and the boy.

15. 2002:  On the morning of Sep 11, 2001, freelance photographer Steve Ludlum was walking along the Brooklyn waterfront when he saw black smoke pouring from the North Tower of the World Trade Center on the other side of the river.  Ludlum ran home for his camera and found a friend to drive him to the Manhattan Bridge.
Ludlum rested his zoom lens on the iron railing and adjusted his camera.  As he was adjusting the camera, United Airlines Flight 175 was headed toward the South Tower.  He didn’t see the plane hit, but a ball of fire appeared in his viewfinder.  Ludlum released the shutter, thinking all the while it was a bomb.
Ludlum’s usual photo lab was too busy, so he went to a one hour drugstore service.  Ninety minutes later Ludlum went to the New York Times with his film.
The New York Times staff photographers were among the first to arrive at the World Trade Center.  Because communications were disrupted, The Times editors had no way of knowing if their photographers were alive.  After risking their lives to record the destruction of the World Trade Center, they fought through smoke and falling debris to deliver their film to the Times.  Ludlum’s photograph was submitted as part of the Times’ portfolio.

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">The Craziest Things Confiscated By The TSA</a>
1. This conversation must have gone something like this: "Sorry, sir, but spearguns are not allowed on the plane..." OBVIOUSLY.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108043.jpg">

2. This is a World War II blasting machine taken off someone in Atlanta, GA.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108044.jpg">

3. Who honestly tries to bring a cannon in their carry-on?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108045.jpg">

4. That's a cane that also doubles as a stun gun.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108046.jpg">

5. Just imagine someone actually trying to use bear spray in the enclosed environment of an airplane? No thanks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108047.jpg">

6. Someone in Vermont honestly thought they could board a plane with this giant wooden mallet.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108048.jpg">

7. Of course, people also try to sneak in plenty of hidden knives...like this one concealed in a lipstick case.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108049.jpg">

8. Phone case or knife?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108050.jpg">

9. Yes, that is a mini saw hiding inside a Bible.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108051.jpg">

10. Even though everything on TV and in movies says you can't smuggle drugs onto a plane, that doesn't stop everyone. These guys tried to smuggle cocaine aboard by hiding it in some raw meat.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108052.jpg">

11. Hollowing out school books isn't a very effective drug smuggling method.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108053.jpg">

12. Then, of course, you have the people trying to bring their sword canes on the plane.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108054.jpg">

13. Obviously you're going to get caught with this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108055.jpg">

14. Seriously?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108056.jpg">

15. Even though it should be common knowledge that you can't bring your gun with you on a plane, people still try. This is America, after all.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108057.jpg">

16. Think the attempted gun smugglers are bad? They're nothing compared to the attempted grenade smugglers.

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">20 Scientific Facts About Space to Expand Your Mind</a>
1. "There are many many mindboggling facts. My favorite one is always cold welding. Due to lack of oxygen - and in consequence lack of corrosion - you can put two pieces of metal together in the vacuum of space, and they will permanently connect, forming a single piece of metal almost instantly." - myhamsterisajerk

 https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vzlxcd/whats_a_fact_about_space_which_will_always_blow/
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224877.jpg">

2. "Imagine our entire solar system is the size of a beach ball. And you put that beach ball on a beach on the US east coast. The closest "beach ball" to us in the galaxy is on a beach in Portugal. We sent a probe out decades ago and as far as we know, it has only just recently reached the edge of our own beach ball." - seamustheseagull
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224878.jpg">

3. "Space Fabric. Imagine somehow being able to build a spacecraft which can resist any kind of gravity and other critical conditions, then fly inside black hole just beyond event horizon for a split second and fly back, after exit our galaxy likely doesn't exist anymore even from your PoV it was just there few seconds ago and no one knows how many billions of years you've been there from an Earth's time perspective. Or one would simply die together with the universe and the black hole the same second they go beyond the event horizon who knows." - ExacoCGI
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224879.jpg">

4. "That there is enough space between the Earth and our Moon to fit in all the other planets." - decitertiember
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224880.jpg">

5. "The sheer size of it always blows my mind. Just the observable universe is 93 billion light-years in diameter, and it’s estimated that the actual universe is about 250x times that." - CymroCam
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224881.jpg">

6. "The fact that space isn't just the backdrop in which everything occurs. It actually bends in response to gravity. When you see the James Webb pics for example with the gravitational lensing, the light is going "straight" in that's it's doing what light does and taking the shortest path from A to B. However, space is being bent which is why the shortest path is curved. It's wild that it's warping around us." - RPC3
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224882.jpg">

7. "that everything in the universe is actually moving through spacetime at the exact same velocity: C, you, me, a rock, and a photon, are all traveling at the same speed." - EvidenceOfReason
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224883.jpg">

8. "Space," the Hitchhiker's Guide says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen . . ." and so on." - ShiningRayde
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224884.jpg">

9. "The fact that 'normal' matter only equates to around 5% of the universe as we know it...The rest of it - Dark energy and matter is largely unknown." - huskyhoonigan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224885.jpg">

10. "Pretty much everything you look at isn’t even there anymore" - Special-Conference41
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224886.jpg">

11. "The boötes void. It has a radius of 165 million light years wide, and contains only 60 galaxies in a space that would be expected to have around 2000" - Butter_Garlic_Naan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224887.jpg">

12. "That we sent a robot 35 MILLION miles away. That robot took a selfie and sent it back." - JoaneHan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224888.jpg">

13. "The largest black hole is the size of Jupiter......'s orbit around the sun" - groovy604
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224889.jpg">

14. "That we really went to the fucking moon. Imagine telling that to someone from 500 years ago." - ipakookapi
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224890.jpg">

15. "I wouldn't say fact as it's impossible to know for sure but it's believed that the universe is expanding outwards in three dimensions faster than the speed of light. Further more, if you some how could travel to the edge, what would happen if you continued past it? What's outside of the expanding universe?" - Singulant
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224891.jpg">

16. "And then you realise 10 billion suns could fit in the largest star" - chug-mug
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224892.jpg">

17. "Light cannot bend, however objects that have mass can bend the space around them and if light passes through this space then it appears to bend. Buttttt because light travels at a constant speed and if it travels through this bended space it means that light is taking longer to reach its destination, this is impossible as light cannot slow down and is technically not bending, therefore in this bended space time SLOWS down. Blows my mind everytime I think about it." - mister1bollock
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224893.jpg">

18. "That we will never be able to explore all of it." - roguediamond
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224894.jpg">

19. "I read somewhere that there is no definite center of the universe because it is expanding infinitely in all directions. Thus any point in the universe is a center - making you the center of the universe." - Common-Transition973
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224895.jpg">

20. "A photon released during a super nova in some far off galaxy could have spent billions of years and traveled across the entire universe just to end up hitting someone's butt while they were laying on a beach." - HumpieDouglas

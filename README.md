## <a href="#link2" id="link1">10 Children's Toys That Got Banned From Sale</a>
1. Sky Dancers - The little wind-up and spin through the air fairies were everywhere in the 90s and they were wreaking havoc. The Consumer Product Saftey Commission in 2000 stated when recalling the toy, "Galoob has received 170 reports of the dolls striking children and adults resulting in 150 reports of injuries. They include eye injuries, including scratched corneas and incidents of temporary blindness, broken teeth, a mild concussion, a broken rib, and facial lacerations that required stitches."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414615.jpg">

2. Yo-Yo Water Ball - Illinois, New Jersey and New York have all at one time or another banned Yo-Yo Water Balls, not only from stretch strings that wrap around kid's necks but also because the ball itself is made of flammable diesel hydrocarbons.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414616.jpg">

3. Vibrating Nimbus 2000 Broom - This toy was quickly pulled from the market for obvious reasons....
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414617.jpg">

4. Moon Shoes - The little babies that were popular in the late 70s up until the 90s were everywhere and at least one friend you had got injured on them. These little trampolines for your feet could cause a broken or twisted ankle in the blink of an eye.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414618.jpg">

5. Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids - These creepy little bastards were supposed to eat pre-packaged plastic food that comes with it. However, it would eat ANYTHING that got close to its close little mouth, which made it ideal for hair pulling fiascos and emergency room visits,
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414619.jpg">

6. The Breast Milk Baby - This baby doll that was introduced in Spain caused outrage among parents, thinking that the doll sexualized young girls, allowing them to "breast feed" the creepy doll.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414620.jpg">

7. SI: Fingerprint Examination Kit and CSI: Investigation Forensics Lab Kit - This seemed like an alright idea at the time, but what parents didn't know that the finger print powder that came with this popular 2007 board game was chalked FULL of asbestos.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414621.jpg">

8. Black Canary Barbie - Who ever thought up the idea for this spin on Barbie, definitely likes the occasional spanking. The Black Canary Barbie was marketed as a super hero, but parents were right to see it as nothing more than S&M Barbie.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414622.jpg">

9. Caylee Sunshine Doll - Someone actually made a doll from Casey Anthony's dead daughter's likeness, naming it a Caylee Sunshine doll. No wonder it sparked such outrage and was pulled almost immediately
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414623.jpg">

10. African American Oreo Barbie - Being quickly released and taken off the shelves in 1990, whoever thought up Oreo Barbie must've not realized that Oreo is a derogatory term for African Americans. They were probably not working at Mattel long after this.

1. Erebus – This haunted house in “Haunted Pontiac, Michigan” has a running total of almost 1,000 “wetters, pukers, and fainters” so far.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158808.jpg">

2. McKamey Manor – You’ve got to be at least 21 and willing to sign a waiver to experience this four-to-six-hour bondage and torture session in San Diego. Fun!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158810.jpg">

3. The House of Shock – New Orleans is one of the most haunted cities in the world, so it figures it would also be home to one of the most intense haunted houses.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158815.jpg">

4. Fear Overload Scream Park – The centerpiece of this haunted attraction in San Leandro, CA is “7 Deadly Sins,” a Se7en-inspired murder-maze navigated with a flashlight in otherwise complete darkness.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158804.png">

5. Blood Manor – It’s called “Blood Manor” but the theme of this massive 5,000-square-foot maze in New York City is “insane asylum,” albeit a bloody one.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158806.jpg">

6. Terror Behind the Walls – A former prison complex in Philadelphia is now Terror Behind the Walls, a prison-escape-themed haunted attraction with “Touch” and “No Touch” variants

7. Fear Experience – Cleveland’s premiere haunted attraction started as “zombie laser tag,” but has expanded to include myriad other varieties of shock and horror.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158811.jpg">

8. The 13th Gate – This Baton Rouge frightfest puts an even higher premium on realism and believability than usual for the form, which might make it a good choice for anyone on the fence about going to medical school.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158813.jpg">

9. The Hex House – Tulsa, OK’s Hex House borrows its storyline from one of Oklahoma’s most notorious criminals: Carolann Smith, who kept two women as hypnotized slaves back in the 1940s.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158814.jpg">

10. The Dent Schoolhouse – Another haunted house that borrows from real life is The Dent Schoolhouse in Cincinnati, which is purportedly located in an actual old haunted schoolhouse.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85158807.jpg">

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Guy Makes An Amazing Flying Burger Commercial Without CGI Effects</a>
1. The technique is known as "burger drop" and can be made with computer effects...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224900.jpg">

2. ...but this was created without CGI.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224901.gif">

3. Miami photographer Steve Giralt spent a month creating PATRIC - Precision Arduino Timing Relay Imaging Controller that made it possible.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224902.jpg">

4. Creating the effect of burger shaping itself wasn't easy, but Giralt said he had to prove that it's posible without the computer effects that are everywhere these days.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224903.jpg">

5. It took 10 tries to film the flying ingredients, only 4 of them forming a burger, but to hit it with mustard and ketchup was a challenge for 20 tries. Placing the beer without it spilling took 10 tries.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224904.jpg">

6. Steve said he did it for the challenge and the month was too long, he could've done it quicker but he had other assignments.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224905.jpg">

7. A burning passion or too much free time? You decide.

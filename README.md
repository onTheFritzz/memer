## <a href="#link1" id="link0">Trucker Gets A Tattoo Of Himself As An Even Smaller Trucker On His Chest</a>
1. I can't help but laugh when I see the dumb look on his face knowing how proud of himself he must be.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85421501.jpg">

2. I wonder if he thought of the idea himself or if one of his trucking buddies challenged him into getting it. Either way, it's pretty epic.

3. It looks like he has a few more sessions before it's complete and it looks like his shoulders will be the tires, but I just can't help but wonder if they tattoo is exhaust pipe too. Now that's not an image anyone would want to see anytime soon.

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Twitter Reacts To Ed Sheeran's Game Of Thrones Cameo</a>
1. Last night Ed Sheeran made his cameo, in the Season 7 premiere of Game Of Thrones, as a soldier singing songs in the forest and the internet had a lot to say about it. Many people thought it took away from the realism of the show or that he was too much of a distraction, but like much that is discussed online, not everyone was in agreement.

2. Officers responded to a 911 call from a woman who reported her 81-year-old mother missing. It seems her mother left her house to take her daily walk up and down the driveway, but when she didn’t return, things got a bit scary because the woman’s mother has dementia. Officers P. DeBoe, C. Caywood, B. Morrison, Sgt. C. Black, and Cpl. C. Clevenger and his K9 partner responded to the scene and began a search of the heavily wooded area.
After 40 minutes, the woman was found. At first, she seemed confused at the sudden appearance of police officers on the tree-lined trail, and she asked if the officers were out taking a walk too. They quietly replied ‘Yes,” after all, it was a beautiful day. And then she seemed relieved and told them she had lost her way. “No problem,” said Officer Morrison who then gently took her hand and, along with the other officers walked her back to her house. Along the way, the officers made small talk with the woman, to make her feel at ease. When asked what the key to a long, healthy life was, the woman replied, “Eat good and stay active.”

18. Adel Termos was walking in an open-air market with his daughter in southern Beirut’s Bourj al-Barajneh district when he heard a blast. A bomb had detonated. Glass and debris went flying. There was mayhem. When Termos noticed a second suicide bomber preparing to attack, he made a split-second decision to tackle the assailant.
The bomb went off, killing Termos. But his sacrifice saved dozens, if not hundreds, of lives.

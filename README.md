## <a href="#link9" id="link8">17 Famous Ghosts Pictures That Can't Be Explained</a>
1. Child at the Railroad Crossing. Several children were killed at a railroad crossing located in San Antonia, Texas. Locals will tell you that their ghosts still linger at the spot, and will push idle cars across the track – even though the path is uphill.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787043.jpg">

2. Freddy Jackson. A squadron of the Royal Air Force assembled to take a mundane photograph, but after the picture was developed the squad quickly realized that this was no ordinary picture. Standing behind one of his mates was the two days deceased Freddy Jackson. He had been working when he was killed in a freak-accident by an air plane propeller. Several of the other men in the photo confirmed that it was in fact Jackson’s face in the background of the picture.

3. The Madonna of Bachelor’s Grove. Bachelor’s Grove Cemetery, located in Illinois, is considered to be one of the most haunted places in the world. This picture depicts a lady resting on a bench, but there wasn’t anyone else in the cemetery at the time.

4. Back Seat Driver. This famous ghost photograph was taken in 1959 by Mable Chinnery. After visiting the grave of her mother, Mable turned and took a picture of her husband, who was waiting for her in the car.

5. The Bell Witch. Back in the 1800’s, a Tennessee farmer was reported to be at the mercy of an executed witch. John Bell documented all sorts of harassment, which included noises in the walls, being pinched, slapped, having objects thrown at him and animals being spooked with no visible cause.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787047.jpg">

6. Lord of the Chair. Lord Combermere was killed by a horse drawn carriage back in 1891. While waiting for the family to return from the funeral, the photographer snapped this photo of Combermere’s favorite chair.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787048.jpg">

7. The Ghost of Boothill Graveyard. Terry Clanton snapped a photo of his friend dressed as a cowboy in a famous Arizona graveyard. When he had the photos developed, he was shocked to see a man dressed as a cowboy in the background. “I know there was no other person in this photograph when I shot it,” Clanton insists.

8. The Brown Lady of Raynham Court. In the 18th century, Lady Dorothy Townshend was locked away when her husband found out she was having an affair. She died under mysterious circumstances in 1726 and sightings of a female figure on the stairs began shortly after.

9. Corroboree Rock Spirit. Taken by Reverend R.S. Blance at Corroboree Rock, Northern Territory, Australia in 1959, this famous photograph appears to show a woman holding her hands toward her face peering out into the distance.

10. The Farm Ghost. Neil Sandbach was out taking a few scenic shots of a farm in Hertfordshire, England. Sandbach was astonished whenever he had the film developed, and noticed a little boy. When he asked the locals about it, several admitted to seeing a young boy in white night clothes.

11. The Ghost of Grandpas Past. Denise Russell snapped a photo of her grandmother and claims she inadvertently captured her deceased grandfather in the background.

12. Amityville Horror Ghost. Not everyone realizes that the movie was inspired by real events that happened to a family on Long Island. This picture was discovered among evidence taken by actual demonologists who investigated the house in 1976. No children were present in the house at the time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787054.jpg">

13. The Tulip Staircase Ghost. A photo taken by Reverend Ralph Hardy of ‘The Tulip Staircase’ at the National Maritime Museum in England depicts an eerie figure. Experts who have studied the original negative have universally concluded that the film had not been tampered with.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787055.jpg">

14. The Fire Girl. In 1995, Wem Town Hall in England caught fire. No one was inside, but snapshots revealed the image of a young girl believed to be Jane Churm who, in 1677, accidentally started a fire that destroyed many homes in the town.

15. The Stanley Hotel’s Haunted Piano. Guests have said Flora, an artist who died in this Colorado hotel long ago, returns to play the piano every now and then, and she’s just one of many spotted there. No wonder it inspired Stephen King to write ‘The Shining.’
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787057.jpg">

16. The Grey Lady of Hampton Court. A ghostly figure was caught on surveillance slamming doors near one of King Henry the VIII’s favorite spots. Some say it’s Henry’s 5th wife, Catherine Howard, who was dragged out screaming after being accused of adultery.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787058.gif">

17. Disney’s Haunted Mansion Ghost. A 2009 YouTube video — presumably of Disneyland surveillance footage — shows a grim grinning ghost cruising around Diseyland’s Haunted Mansion and Rivers of America areas after hours. The Park was totally empty, giving him plenty of space to roam around the sidewalks and grass. He even walks on water near the end of the tape.

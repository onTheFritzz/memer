5. The Apollo 1 Tragedy:
the orbit with Virgil “Gus” Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee on board. Tragically, however, the spacecraft was destroyed in a cabin fire during a launch pad test 50 years ago.
On January 27, 1967 Apollo 1 was sitting on the launch pad atop a Saturn 1B rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, the precursor to the Saturn V. It was set to perform a “plugs-out” test, during which both the launch vehicle and the spacecraft were not loaded with fuel and all pyrotechnic systems were disabled. The task was merely to prepare Apollo 1 for its launch on February 21, 1967 by running through various system procedures.
During the second run through the checklist, the fire started. The 100% oxygen atmosphere fed the electrical fire, the increasing pressure rupturing the capsule wall. Shrapnel injured ground crew, while smoke billowed out to smother them. Within 26 seconds, the horrified ground team heard garbled voices yelling, and saw flame sweeping across the camera. It took five full minutes for the ground crew to peel open all three hatches, trading off as heat and smoke forced them to retreat.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">How Long Has It Been Since The Chicago Cubs Won A World Series?</a>
1. 
The last time the Chicago cubs won a world series was in 1908. Many  sports conspiracy theorists believe this is due to the Curse of the Billy Goat, which started in 1945 when, Billy Goat Tavern owner, Billy Sianis was asked to leave game 4 of the World Series against the Detroit Tigers at Wrigley Field because the odor of his pet goat Murphy was bothering fans. Sianis was so outraged that he declared, “Them Cubs, they ain’t gonna win no more”, and guess what, he was right. Now here we are, more than 100 years later and still no World Series title for the Cubs even though they have played in seven series since there win in 1908. So to commemorate the Cubs’ great season and their newest chance at ending a 100 years old cruse, here is a list of all the things that have happened since their last win in 1908.

3. Take pictures of your hair after a good haircut. If you ever need to see a new barber, a picture’s worth a thousand words
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495134.jpg">

4. If you’re buying a used car, make sure to check that the check engine light turns on when you insert the key into the 2nd position and the dash lights up. If not, it likely means they removed the bulb to hide a problem
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495135.jpg">

5. When a stranger asks you to take a photo of a group, take several before and during the “3 2 1” countdown
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495143.jpg">

6. There are still 10,000 puppy mills in the United States. If you’re buying a dog, insist on seeing the breeder’s facilities
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495137.jpg">

7. There’s no such thing as “Just one more time”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495144.jpg">

8. Stop comparing yourself to others. Instead, compare yourself to where you were 1-2 years ago. Whether it’s fitness or finance, use that as motivation for your own goals.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495140.jpg">

9. If you’re ever called by your bank’s fraud department hang up and call them back
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495141.jpg">

10. To avoid the fake, cheesy smile on young kids when you try to take their picture, ask them to tell you a joke while you take it, but tell them that they should absolutely not laugh while telling it. Beautiful pictures every time of glee.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495142.jpg">

11. Use the FORD method when you don’t know what to say in conversation: 

F – Family (Their S/O, kids, siblings, pets, family traditions)
O – Occupation (What do they do? How did they get into it? Where did they go to school?)
R – Recreation (What do they like to do?)
D – Dreams (Ask about their goals, dreams, and aspirations)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495139.jpg">

12. Great idea for pet owners
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495138.jpg">

13. When walking your dogs, make them sit and wait before crossing streets. This will make them hesitate about running into roads if they ever get loose. Works for kids too!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85495136.jpg">

14. When you get into a relationship, make a real effort to hang out with friends who invite you to hang out with them

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">18 Things That Give Us Cult Vibes </a>
1. Some dog owners' groups on Facebook are very culty-like. Got banned from one group for not crate training my pup. I like her sleeping in my bed as it helps with my anxiety. -u/LittleWolfPuppy
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87269655.jpg">

2. Audi ownership (at least in the UK). I had an Audi Q3 as a hire car recently and other Audi drivers were suddenly letting me out at junctions, offering me parking spaces and even stopping to talk to me as if we'd known each other for years.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87269656.jpg">

3. Mommy groups. And even specific groups. Like a cult within a cult. Joined a cloth diapering group. I was excommunicated for using Pampers at night. -u/dollyprincessb

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87269654.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87269664.png">

12. Those insane pro-breastfeeding groups are very cult-like in my experience. (Not bashing breastfeeding, I did it myself. But so many women in those groups talk about formula like it’s literal poison)Similarly those crazy free birth types. -u/prunellazzz

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87269670.jpg">

14. I've found that Stephen King fans are very cult-y - I remember reading something about "how he is the god of the horror genre and every he has written and will write is absolutely gold...he can never write a bad book." -u/Automatic_Ranger_1
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87269671.jpg">

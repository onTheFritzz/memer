## <a href="#link11" id="link10">Detachable Jeans Prove The Fashion Industry Is Just Ridiculous</a>
1. It would appear that 2017 will be the year that fashion declared a war on jeans. After the ridiculous clear plastic jeans debacle, and then the jeans with a zipper on the butt, it seems like people just can't leave the poor denim alone.

Oh, but they're not done.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359312.jpg">

2. Now Opening Ceremony is trying to make “detachable cut-out front jeans” happen, and it’s up to us to stop it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359313.jpg">

3. Designed by Y/Project, they can be worn as full-length trousers, with your under-butt and groin exposed.

“These 2-in-1 Y/Project trousers come in a straight-leg silhouette with slim-fitting, detachable shorts that feature high-rise cutouts along the front,” reads Opening Ceremony’s product description.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359314.jpg">

4. One word: CLASSY.

But if you’re feeling extra bold, you can detach the legs of the jeans and wear them as denim shorts. Don’t forget the heels, apparently.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359315.png">

5. The kicker?

These bad boys will set you back a whopping $425.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359316.png">

6. But for the low price of $424.99, I will personally cut the ass out of your jeans for you.

What a steal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359317.jpg">

7. Behold a pair of jeans that unzip down your butt crack.As part of its partnership with Levis, Vetements has come out with its new pair of “high-rise distressed” jeans. Nothing in that title alludes to the zipper down your butt crack, but there it is.

You can’t really miss it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359318.jpg">

8. Just in case you were wondering, the jeans also have zippers going down the back of the leg as well.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359320.jpg">

9. Vetements is one of the major “tastemakers” in fashion, which is why it’ll get away with selling these new zipper-heavy jeans for $1,870.This look doesn’t come cheap.
If the jeans appear too constricting despite the air for your derriere, there is also a shorts version.

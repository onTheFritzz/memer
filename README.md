## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Guy Finds Walt Disney Stock In His Great Uncle's Old Safe</a>
1. "This is where the safe was when we first got to it. Underneath the stairs in my Great Uncle Ray's basement. The farmhouse has been in our family for several generations and is slated to be torn down, so no one's quite sure exactly how long the safe has been down there or who the original purchaser was, and I was running out of time to rescue it. I plan on doing more research in the future. This was a picture from our first attempt at getting the safe out. My friend and I had a furniture dolly and thought we could get it just the two of us. We got it on the dolly with relative ease but once we tried to get it up the first step we quickly realized we had been beaten by an inanimate object... for now."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456906.jpg">

2. "A few weeks later my dad and I came back with the big guns to get this thing out.  We made this ramp out of 1x12's that were screwed together with 1x1's on the back to catch the treads and prevent slipping."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456907.jpg">

3. We knew man power wasn't going to be enough to pull this thing up the stairs and we weren't messing around so we attached a tow strap to a chain in order to pull it up the stairs and around the corner with our skid loader.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456908.jpg">

4. "Originally we had the safe on the dolly and we tried to tie the tow strap to that a few different ways and pull it up. Neither way worked.  This was our third attempt with the skid loader, fourth attempt if you count my friend and I's feeble attempt at lifting it over that 1 inch lip you see in this picture (it didn't budge).  This rig didn't work either as the safe wanted to tip to the side and slide out on its way up. 4th attempt didn't work either. The weight shifted and the safe swung over and almost pinned me against the wall as I was guiding it up the ramp. Finally the rig worked!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456909.jpg">

5. "We think the safe weighed somewhere between 800-1,000 lbs; definitely not a two man lift job. Talking with my grandpa he distinctly remembers this safe being around when he was a kid on the farm. and he remembers when Ray moved the safe from the original farmhouse a few miles away to the one he lived in the rest of his life where we eventually removed it. How they got it down there I don't know. However, my grandpa seems to remember his father saying it was originally purchased by HIS father, the original Jacob in the family. My grandpa is still pretty sharp so I wouldn't doubt that for a second."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456910.jpg">

6. "We got it in place in my garage without too much more effort.  I cleaned it off a bit and here she sets. After speaking with my grandpa about the safe, I learned quite a bit and now he came out to the house and handed me a piece of paper.  It was a copy of the original manufacturer's sheet with the combination on it! Time to crack this bad boy open."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456911.jpg">

7. "The lock design was unlike any I had seen before in that it had 4 entries.  You had to spin to the first number clockwise, then had to rotate the dial 3 times counter clockwise to the second number, then 2 times clockwise again to the 3rd number, and finally 1 time counter clockwise to the final number as per the manufacturer's instructions.  If my grandpa hadn't brought that sheet because I never would have figured that out if he'd just had the combination numbers written down."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456912.jpg">

8. "Ray was notorious for being a hoarder when it came to anything related to his money and was the family scrooge, so I had no clue what to expect when I turned this key. I was really glad to see that the key was already inside the safe. When I first opened it and saw another door I was afraid that was the end of the road."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456913.jpg">

9. "Documents on documents on documents!  Oh look, a jewelry compartment... and another key!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456914.jpg">

10. Nothing in the jewelry compartment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456915.jpg">

11. "Time to start sifting through all the documents.  Mostly information on annuities he set up for himself and a few select charities through his personal trust, life insurance policies, and some outdated last will and testaments. Being a farmer in middle of nowhere Illinois sure wasn't earning him many dividends and he knew that. Ray was a smart guy when it came to finance and it was great to know him before the strokes and everything got to him and he eventually passed."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85456916.jpg">

12. "These were by far the most interesting find. Two stock certificates for The Walt Disney Company, one for 20 shares and one for 10 shares. It was our understanding that my great uncle's trust (whose name the certificates are in) had been closed out and liquidated upon his passing. But as many people told me, these certificates were most likely still outstanding since paper certificates are turned in or destroyed when cashed out. It also turned out that the stocks were purchased right before a stock split so the 30 shares could actually be 60 or even 90 shares! So off to my financial advisor I went!! After getting in touch with them and doing some paperwork and research it turns out these certificates ARE still outstanding!!! I am freaking out guys. All shares that were earned after the stocks were split have been liquidated since they weren't issued as paper stocks and were either liquidated over time by my great uncle or sold off when he passed. But these 30 Shares remain! My grandpa and I are going through the process of changing the names on the certificates out of my great uncle's trust so that they will be valid again.

12. The Werewolf of Wysteria – Albert Fish – convicted child rapist and cannibal, boasted he “had children in every state.” 

Here is the letter he sent to the mother of one of his victims:
“My dear Mrs Budd,
In 1894 a friend of mine shipped as a deck hand on the steamer Tacoma, Capt John Davis. They sailed from San Francisco to Hong Kong China. On arriving there he and two others went ashore and got drunk. When they returned the boat was gone. At that time there was a famine in China. Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold to the Butchers to be cut up and sold for food in order to keep others from starving. A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street. You could go in any shop and ask for steak – chops – or stew meat. Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it. A boy or girls behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as veal cutlet brought the highest price. John staid there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh. On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys one 7 one 11. Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet then burned everything they had on. Several times every day and night he spanked them – tortured them – to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the 11 yr old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except Head – bones and guts. He was roasted in the oven, (all of his ass) boiled, broiled, fried, stewed. The little boy was next, went the same way. At that time I was living at 409 E 100 St, rear – right side. He told me so often how good human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the 3 – 1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St. Brought you pot cheese – strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her, on the pretense of taking her to a party. You said Yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick – bite and scratch. I choked her to death then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me 9 days to eat her entire body. I did not fuck her, though, I could of had I wished. She died a virgin.”

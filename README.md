## <a href="#link1" id="link0">#TBT: 90s Television Edition</a>
1. Whether you were a 90s kid or just were really into not being on the internet all the time, the 90s was the perfect time to be T.V. obsessed. Now with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime you can stream all of the content you want. A show is released and it's the entire season, the term  "binge watch" has entered our communal lexicon.   But in a few years when you're gray and wrinkly, you'll think fondly of 90s television, pointing your cane at young people, shouting, "In my day we had to wait a whole WEEK to see what Mulder and Scully were up to!" Here are some titles to take you back.

2. Unsolved Mysteries - This was the show that freaked out a generation. Even the beginning of the theme song was enough to make shivers crawl up your spine. The host Robert Stack comes out of a smokey alleyway and tells you about aliens, killers, and ghost for an hour. No thanks.

3. Seinfeld - This show about nothing, about four neurotic New Yorkers, and all their troubles had people tuning in week after week. If you missed an episode one week and came to school hearing people scream out "Soup Nazi!" and "Shrinkage!" you would have no idea what they were talking about.

4. The Fresh Prince of Bel Air - The show that launched Will Smith's career was one that America loved for years. Following a kid from the rough neighborhoods of Philly to the up-scale neighborhood of Bel Air, Will's interactions with high society and his Uncle Phil had us in stitches. And hey, if we didn't have this show you wouldn't have your precious Carlton memes.

5. Twin Peaks - One of the weirdest and most addictive shows of all time, this creation from famed director David Lynch really had people talking. Following the murder of a beautiful high school girl, a detective played by Kyle MacLachlan descends into a sinister and bizarre world in small town America. This show had people saying the next day, "What the hell happened on that show last night?"

6. Beverly Hills, 90210 - The quintessential show for teens who think no one understands them and dream to move to Hollywood. Beverly Hills, 90210 followed a brother and sister as they experience high school, love triangles, betrayal, college, leaving the show, having sideburns unironically, among a slew of other privileged troubles .

7. Ren and Stimpy - Possibly the grossest cartoon ever made, Ren and Stimpy was the cool alt-cartoon that had teens and adults, and kids who sneaked to the living room to watch it, going nuts. Ren, a pissed off chihuahua and Stimpy a dumb cat go on multiple adventures with insane characters, gross closeups, ultra-violent acts and a slew of catchy songs written for the cartoon in tow.

8. Buffy the Vampire Slayer - A hot girl fighting vampires, demons and forces of darkness? Yeah, that show existed in the 90s. Launching the career of Sarah Michelle Gellar, this show was a smash hit and brought the paranormal fascination of the 90s into every home in the country. Also, this was the first time the world was introduced to Joss Whedon, who would go on to direct huge blockbusters.

9. The Wonder Years - Arguably one of the shows that absolutely nails what it's like to grow up America. Kevin Arnold, along with his best friend Paul Pfeiffer and crush Wendy Cooper, comes to age in anywhere U.S.A; facing love, the death of loved ones, puberty, the Vietnam War, first jobs and general growing pains. The Joe Cocker cover of the Beatles as the theme song is enough to make fans of the show come to tears.

10. Kids in the Hall -  This underground alt-comedy sketch show was one of the first Canadian shows that America really paid attention to. The show's sketches with players Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Scott Thompson, Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney, borderlined on the absurd, with definite tips of the hat to Monty Python's Flying Circus. Even though the Chicken Lady was absolutely terrifying.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85158826.jpg">

11. The X-Files - In the 1990s the world was wrapped up in the paranormal, with UFO sightings at an all time high and Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM being a late night driving staple. It was the perfect time for The X-Files, an FBI drama that follows Agents Mulder and Scully as they investigate extraterrestrial, paranormal and bizarre cases and murders. This show also launched the career of Vince Gilligan, who went on to create Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.

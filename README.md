## <a href="#link3" id="link2">14 Conspiracy Theories Proven To Be True</a>
1. You probably grew up hearing this, that breakfast is "the most important meal of the day," but many theorists thought it was a lie, a reverse conspiracy for big companies to sell more breakfast, and turns out... they were right!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233695.jpg">

Well, it turns out that "breakfast is the most important meal of the day" was actually a commercial slogan created by Kellogg's to help sell their new breakfast cereal. The phrase didn't have an ounce of truth—it was just advertising.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233696.jpg">

2. Another one that is, unfortunately, true is that the American government (it is almost always the American), between 1932 and 1972, purposely infected 400 African American men with syphilis. These men were unaware of that and they never gave their consent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233699.jpg">

The study aimed to verify whether sexually transmitted diseases affected black men as they affected white men. When the ominous experiment came to an end, only 74 of the original participants were alive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233697.jpg">

3. Unfortunately for these poor people, this was also true. Since the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) was founded in 1947, several theories about what they actually do started to appear, one of which being that they would have drugged and tortured innocent people in illegal experiments, and as we said, unfortunately, that was true.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233700.jpg">

The experiment was called MKULTRA. Its objective was to learn to manipulate people mentally. The CIA then used several methods, including the secret administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs (mainly LSD) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, and several other forms of torture.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233701.jpg">

It took a few years for the theory to go from conspiracy to facts. The operation started in 1953 but was only revealed to the public in 1975, which led the CIA to destroy the documents in order to deny the story. To this day they continue with their experiments, although the American government has always denied them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233702.jpg">

4. I mean, c'mon! Imagine you are walking on the street and out of nowhere, a stranger comes to tell you about how the USA was using children's corpses to do nuclear tests. You would probably laugh in his face and think the guy was crazy, wouldn't you? But, sadly, this is yet another conspiracy that has proved to be true.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233703.jpg">

The government was actually stealing body parts because they needed young human tissue for their tests. They recruited a worldwide network of agents to find recently deceased babies and children and then collect samples and even limbs from them, all without the permission of more than 1,500 grieving families. A mother was not allowed to dress her daughter for her funeral because the doctors had already amputated her legs and did not want her to find out.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233704.jpg">

5. Seriously, who in their right mind would imagine that something so ridiculous was true, especially from Canada? But it was.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233705.jpg">

In the 1950s, the Canadian government created the so-called "fruit machine" to identify who was gay in order to fire them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233706.jpg">

But how did this "gaydar" work? They basically showed images of gay pornography and monitored people's reactions, such as pupil dilation, and if it showed a "gay reaction," it was recorded.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233707.jpg">

6. Today it seems stupid to not know that cigarettes are bad for your health, but back in the 1930s until 1950, all people saw were advertisements saying how good cigarettes were for you, advertisements that came with phrases from legitimate doctors saying "do not worry."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87233708.jpg">

For decades, anyone who dared to say that cigarettes were not good, but a poison, were labeled crazy, idiots, or even enemies of the state, since the government made a lot of money with taxes on this product. And when the truth finally came out, what did the companies say? Simple, that they also did not know that cigarettes were harmful to our health.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">24 Major World Events That Were Probably Staged</a>
1. In the UK a spy was found dead in his apartment. He drowned in his bath, locked inside a North Face duffel bag. The lock was on the outside of the bag. Official verdict into his death… Suicide -u/zwifter11
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271281.jpg">

2. In 1964, the USS Maddox was attacked in Vietnam in what became known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident. This act convinced Congress to let the president put boots on the ground in Vietnam and essentially started the war. However, documents declassified in the early 2000s revealed this was actually a false-flag operation. -u/Looks_at_this_clown
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271283.jpg">

3. The War on Drugs. Once you read about how Harry J. Anslinger manufactured the marijuana scare just to keep his job, you’ll realize how crazy the entire situation is. Anslinger was the DEA version of J. Edgar Hoover, and before the DEA even existed. -u/ghostful86
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271285.png">

4. I completely believe that James Earl Ray did not kill Martin Luther King Jr., instead, I believe he was an unknowing asset or the fall guy. An opinion that is actually shared with the King family (who were actually involved in a court case about it) and do not believe JER shot MLK. -u/TheRunicHammer
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271286.jpg">

5. The 2016 "coup" in Turkey was staged to solidify Erdogan's presidency. -u/leffe123
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271287.png">

6. Dale Jr. winning the July NASCAR race at Daytona after his father was killed in an accident there in February. -u/IdahoPatMan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271289.jpg">

7. “Internet Backlash.” There are maybe a handful of real people and a million bots making all the news and all the decisions right now. -u/fishintheboat
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271290.jpg">

8. Not an event per se, but the fact everyone still thinks that Banksy is just one guy, trust me, it’s a well-oiled machine that, even from the 99/2000 had a small team working on it all, it’s been one big money making exercise from the early days, the fact Robin and co are still getting away with it proves it works so good luck to them! -u/Puzzleheaded_Song_70
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271291.jpg">

9. The Great Fire of Rome. But I’m not the only one that thinks this. People think Emperor Nero burned down swaths of the city just so he could buy up the land to make his mansion. The fact that that’s exactly what happened after the fire didn’t help his case. Dude was so evil people theorized he might’ve been the Anti-Christ. -u/BlackDwarfStar
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271292.png">

10. Janet Jackson and "Boobgate." -u/notthesedays
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271293.jpg">

11. Tbh, Flat Earthers. I truly can't believe for a second that with all the technology and photos proving that the Earth

12. The Hawaii missile alert false alarm has three possible scenarios that I'm tossed on:1: It really was a misclick.2: It was a drill to test the preparedness of a missile attack. They wanted to see what a population would do in that scenario.3: It was a real incoming missile attack but the US has top secret missile interception capabilities that nobody knows about; except whatever country actually launched the missile now. I bet the foreign country, in this scenario, would have even figured they did and was just testing to see the full extent of the technology. -u/InfernalOrgasm
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271297.jpg">

13. Jeffrey Epstein committing suicide, way too convenient to be true. Same high security prison that housed El Chapo suddenly doesn't have camera footage of that night and the guards were unaware of what was going on, too? Smells of BS, lol -u/strikershiv95
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271298.jpg">

14. I believe the moon landing was real, but they went out of their way to pack as many tv cameras on the mission as possible, so in the most literal sense it was staged as a media production almost more so than a scientific mission. -u/classyhwale
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271299.jpg">

15. The energy price crisis in the UK right now.I suspect that when Russia Invaded Ukraine the oil companies saw an opportunity to make an unthinkable amount of money and our government are corrupt enough to just let them get away with it. The fact Rishi and Liz seem unwilling to talk about it or sympathise with people is enough proof. -u/Jacorpes
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271280.jpg">

16. Shakespeare's plays. -u/WillCharGames
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271300.jpg">

17. The timing of the release of the Iranian hostages so that Reagan got the credit for it. 100% fishy. -u/Seguefare
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271302.jpg">

18. The popularity of Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen. I'm not saying it's a bad song. But I was pretty up to speed on both memes and pop music at the time, and I definitely saw the memes about the song (like the ones using Maeby from Arrested Development) absolutely flood every meme channel all at once a few weeks before the song was at all popular, not after. Now this sort of thing is pretty common, but I was bewildered that no one else at the time had questioned why this song they never heard was suddenly a meme, like… everywhere.The "staging" is that I'm pretty sure Carly Rae Jepsen's record label astroturfed the Internet hard in 2012 with regard to the popularity of her hit single Call Me Maybe, 4+ years before that sort of thing was really noticed or heard of. -u/film_composer
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271303.jpg">

19. The Max Headroom incident obviously. -u/Puzzleheaded-Art7406

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">20 Dark Secrets People Are More Comfortable Telling Strangers Online Than Their Family</a>
1. My grandma was in a car accident and broke her ankle so she stayed at my house and we took care of her while she recovered. I was entering puberty at the time and discovered that you could order porn on cable and was like a madman ordering porn.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112134/87319154/cable.jpg">

The bill that month came out to $500 my mom thought it was my grandma because her novelas were on like channel 50-60 and the porn was 500-600 lmfaoooo. I’ve literally never told anyone to this day. -pinchefresona

2. My uncle owned an old Camaro that collected dust in his garage. When I was around 10 my family and I were in town visiting and I wrote the word “fuck” in the dust on the hood of the car. I used my thumb so that the letters were fatter than my normal index finger. A few hours later my aunt/uncle asked us who did it and I “proved” it wasn’t me by showing how the person who did it had bigger fingers than me. Taking that shit to my grave! -CLToris

3. That I didn't graduate from college. I failed one course my senior year, 2nd semester. The ceremony was already set up so they let everyone walk. I had no diploma in my award...nobody knows to this day and it's been 17 years. Failed one course, 3 credits. Was ashamed so I never went back for those 3 credits. So everyone believes I graduated. -TheLargeYard

5. It's not my secret, but my mom's. And I'm not hiding it from everyone, just the person who it potentially matters to the most. When my mom was in high school in the 60s, she had a long-term serious boyfriend named Jimmy. They were each other's first, they were together for years, and were planning on getting married. He went away to college, my mom stayed behind, but they were still together. You know what happened next. He cheated and got the new girl pregnant. He comes home to break the news to my mom. Abortion was not legal at the time. He basically says that he wants to be with my mom, but he has no choice but to marry this other girl. My mom was devastated.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112129/87319152/callme.jpg">

Here's the secret: my mom was also pregnant by him, but hadn't told him yet. She decided she wasn't ever going to tell him. Jimmy went on to marry the other girl and never knew my mom was also pregnant. She told me that she later threw herself down a flight of stairs to cause a miscarriage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112142/87319156/churchpoop.jpg">

My mom actually reconnected with Jimmy during the early days of Facebook. She didn't have an account, but asked me to look for him using mine. He was still married to the same person. My mom was married to my dad. They wrote to each other for a while (using my account! ugh!) Signed their messages saying "I Love You."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112144/87319157/elevator.jpg">

My mom passed away a number of years ago. I think about this knowledge I have that Jimmy doesn't. This major life event thing that he doesn't even know happened. That could have changed the trajectory of many lives. I'm certainly not going to tell him. It's not my secret to tell. -kbivs

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112150/87319159/korea.jpg">

7. I had an IBS attack once and had to violently shit in a church grounds behind someone’s car. Used underwear to wipe too and left that there. Not proud. -gotanycrisps

10. My grandpa was stationed in Okinawa, Japan during the Korean war, while in the Marines. He hooked up with a woman there, and she got pregnant. So, I have a Japanese aunt and a few cousins, in Japan, whom I’ve never met before. -Cardinal270

11. Funny, light hearted story from my childhood. My little brother was in the shower, I could hear him singing. I put a coat on backwards, and a stocking cap pulled over my face, and waited outside the bathroom door. He opened the door (still singing, and dancing kinda), and I did the Frankenstein thing. Arms out, moaning “uhhhh”.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112215/87319167/pornsite.jpg">

He screamed and fell backwards knocking the toilet completely over. Water went everywhere, the top of the toilet tank broke, shower curtain ripped down, and him laying on the floor in the middle of all this. I ran back down the hall; coat and hat off, and sauntered back casually. By then my mother and father and our sisters were there, and everyone is like, you know, what the hell. I’ve heard him tell this story as proof of the existence of ghosts. To this day (little feller is now a 52 year old bank manager with two kids)he believes in ghosts. I don’t feel a bit bad. -Jimmysweetspot

12. My wife is handicapped and I lied to her that I find it hard to clean/cut up mushrooms. She has self esteem issues because I can do things much easily than her. So I lied, and now she feels better. -bukake_attack
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112211/87319165/pest.jpg">

13. One of my closest co-workers, who is an integral part to our very large corporation killed a man in his late teens and threw the body in a lake. He only got off on a technicality. I work remotely so I don’t build a lot of personal relationships with people I work with regularly.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112212/87319166/parenting.jpg">

I googled his full name. It freaked me out at first. But I’ve kinda gotten over it. I wonder if anyone else knows. It happened 40+ years ago. He will retire soon and then I might ask another co-worker about it. I just don’t want to stir the pot. -adamsfan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112219/87319168/plans.jpg">

14. My wife and I aren't officially married. No one knows. We had a ceremony and everything, reception... the whole nine yards. We just never did the official paperwork.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Everyday Design Features You Never Knew The Purpose Of</a>
1. Bottom of Wine Bottles.
What's the purpose of the indentation at the bottom of your daily drink of choice? It's to relieve pressure while removing the cork. You'll notice that champagne bottles have an even larger one.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167408.jpg">

2. The Tiny Hole in iPhones.
You'll notice a tiny hole between the lens and flash on your iPhone. It's a microphone! But aren't there already two others? The primary mic, the one you're used to seeing, is used for picking up a variety of noises, including your voice, while the secondary mic picks up ambient noise. There's a noise-canceling circuit that eliminates background noises and makes your voice sound clearer.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167409.jpg">

3. MacBook Charger Hooks.
You've probably learned about this one when it went viral a few years ago but the hooks on your MacBook charger are there to help prevent you from breaking it. The next time you're putting it away, try wrapping it like this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167410.jpg">

4. Bobby Pin Grooves.
Most women are surprised to learn that the grooves actually face the bottom. When you think about it, it makes perfect sense. When they're planted on the bottom, they stay more secure.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167411.jpg">

5. The Hole on the Handles of Pots And Pans.
Chefs sometimes use the hole to hang their pots and pans (great space saving tip) but you can also use it to leave your spoon as your dish simmers, assuming that it will fit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167412.jpg">

6. The Arrow on Your Gas Gauge.
How many times have you stopped at the gas station and forgotten which side you need to pump your gas? Well, this time you don't need to get out of your car to check. Look for the arrow to find out which side the fuel hatch is on.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167413.jpg">

7. Miniature Pocket and Rivets on Jeans.
The smallest pocket in your jeans could barely fit your finger and that's because it was originally meant for a pocket watch. As for the rivets, they look like pointless buttons but they're actually there to reinforce the seams of the pockets. Pockets are vulnerable to rips so this greatly improves the item's endurance.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167414.jpg">

8. The Life-Saving Hole.
According to an article published on The Independent, about 100 people die every year from choking on pen caps. You'll notice that BIC pens have hole at the tip of their lids. This doesn't only prevent it from leaking, it is also to comply with safety standards and reduce the "risk of children accidentally inhaling [them]."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167415.jpg">

9. Plastic Liners Under Bottle Caps.
Check out the blue liner. This pressure seal is softer than the plastic used for the rest of the bottle and helps ensure the freshness and carbonation of your drink.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167416.jpg">

10. Treatments With Spikes.
You're probably well aware of this one unless you found another method to open the tubes. When you purchase an OTC treatment, you might find a little spike beneath the lid. Flip it over and use it to puncture through the protective foil.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167417.jpg">

11. Bumps on the 'F' and 'J' Keys.
These bumps help keep you in line with 10-finger typing. They indicate where the index fingers should rest so you can feel for them rather than looking down, especially if you've got a lot to type.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167418.jpg">

12. Indentation on Tic Tacs Lid.
If you're a Tic Tac maniac like me, you might not find any use for this but if you've got some etiquette, use the lid as a dispenser like this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167419.jpg">

13. The Hole at the Bottom of Padlocks.
These little holes are for drainage and lubrication purposes. Take care of your padlocks and you won't have to buy a new one for years.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167420.jpg">

14. The Serrated Scribing Tool.
When using measuring tape, If you don't have a way to mark the placement of your item, you can use the serrated edge to your advantage. Just press it down and scratch it back and forth.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167421.jpg">

15. Extra Pieces of Fabric.
Sometimes manufacturers will include a sample of fabric with your item of clothing so that you can test it with different laundering techniques. If it's a valuable piece, make sure to test it out so you don't ruin it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167422.jpg">

16. Soda Can Tabs as Straw Holders.
This design is simple yet so under used. Maybe you prefer to pour your drink out of a cup or feel the cool can on your lips, but next time you have a can of soda, try using the tab as a straw holder. All you have to do is pop it open and swivel the tab around and it should stay in place.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167423.jpg">

17. The Breather Hole in Airplane Windows.
If you see a tiny hole in your window while flying, don't panic. The hole is there to regulate the amount of pressure that passes between the inner and outer panes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167424.jpg">

18. Holes on the Side of Converse Shoes.
Did you know that Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars were originally an elite basketball shoe? The holes on the sides are used for ventilation. Some folks also use it to pull the laces into a snugger fit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167425.jpg">

19. Holes in Rulers.
The next time you're holding a ruler, look for the hole or holes along the center axis. This is so you can hang the ruler up. Some rulers have more holes so you can store them in a three-ring binder.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85167426.jpg">

20. The Purpose of Bi-Color Erasers.
Notice how some erasers are soft and pink on one side and firm, gritty, and blue on the other? Some say that the blue is for erasing pen but that doesn't really work. The best answer we've found is that it is used for darker pencil marks and papers of heavy weight and different textures (grainy art paper, for example).

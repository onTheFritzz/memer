## <a href="#link2" id="link1">21 People Share Their Worst Sexual Experiences</a>
1. Met a girl at a bar while I was in college. She was a 10 out of 10. We went back to my place. She blindfolded me on my couch, went to the fridge, and poured Grey Poupon all over my chest and she licked it all off. Was so turned off I called her a cab home. -Mooks555
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/011620/87289159/grey.jpg">

2. Dude tried to give me a shoulder rub while taking me from behind.
Looking at you, Steven. -GTFOakaFOD
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/011839/87289160/rub.jpg">

3. A guy did literal pushups on top of me, no pelvic thrusts lol. -creepydeadgirl
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/012002/87289161/push.jpg">

4. A hookup asked me to rub where her dad shot her. I wish I was a troll. -IceHorse69
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/012411/87289162/gun.png">

5. Had sex with this girl and she had a pendant with the ashes of her dad on and it kept bumping on my head when she was on top. -astraycatsmilkyway
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121202/87289111/cremation.jpg">

6. Her dad walking in after I'd literally just finished. She still had (just) a skirt on but there’s me standing proud and looking very pleased with myself. He stammered "sorry" and closed the door. Needless to say dinners afterwards were interesting. -alpubgtrs234
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121201/87289110/dad.jpg">

7. Hooked up with an Italian guy who refused to take his large gold chain off. It swung so hard it hit me in the face and gave me a black eye. -wanditabonita
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121219/87289117/italianchain.jpg">

8. Masturbating and not realizing I’d touched poison oak. -Poorly-Drawn-Beagle
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121259/87289128/oak.jpg">

9. One girl's meth-dealing brother broke into her apartment while we were doing the deed, and then told me that I was on his turf so I had to enjoy his company until he wanted to leave. I had not met him previously.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121238/87289123/meth.jpg">

Edit - No, he did not want to watch his sister bang, he was asking for food or money or something, I forget. -Jefffahfffah
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121234/87289122/knuckler.jpg">

10. My ex-girlfriend who thought that giving a handjob consists of pulling down the foreskin as far as possible with the most violent strokes. -MYNAMEISHENDRIK
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121208/87289114/champ.png">

11. Ex decided to be fancy and she took a mouthful of champagne before giving me a blowjob. Bubbles from the champagne went up my d*ck hole. Incredibly painful, don't recommend. -Ninja_badgers
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121242/87289125/slap.jpg">

12. Thought it would be hot to get slapped in the face, so I asked to be slapped in the face. I was promptly slapped in the face.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121224/87289119/jalp.jpg">

I found out very quickly I do not enjoy being slapped in the face. -Impastaz72
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121157/87289109/choke.jpg">

13. Ahh, my ex was once fingering me after we had chopped a bunch of jalapeños to make chili.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121204/87289113/doctor.png">

PSA: washing your hands twice is NOT enough. -Manatee3232
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121247/87289126/wax.jpg">

14. Probably a guy that wrapped his legs around my head while I went down on him. He squeezed so tight to the point where I couldn’t breathe. My lizard brain started to panic so I bit down to make him stop so I could breathe. -daedrictofu
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121230/87289121/mint.jpg">

15. A guy told me to go see a doctor because I didn't c*m LOL. -rae_gun_
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121209/87289115/ear.jpg">

16. My roommate was in a dry spell but was really interested in a woman we would see at the bar. She was always with her roommate, who was very protective and wouldn't let her friend stay out past 12 AM.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121239/87289124/police.jpg">

The guardian roommate also could have been a goblin. So, I decided to flirt with her to keep them out later and let my roomie have a chance. It worked, and they went home together. But then the Great Goblin decided I should come home with her. Thinking that a "no" would mean she gets home angry and kills whatever my roomie had going, I decide to go along.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/121255/87289127/spain.jpg">

I mean, I never said "no", but I didn't enjoy any part of that experience. She poured wax on me (and herself), tried to convince me to go bareback, and then said I wasn't big enough to get her off and had me use a baseball bat-size tentacle toy on her. -Minute_Cartoonist509

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">33 Dirty Secrets From Industry Insiders</a>
1. If you yell and scream and throw a big enough fit you get better service. It pi**es me off so much. Our management just rolls over for difficult customers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312844.jpg">

2. Consulting: In many cases, your boss hired us because he doesn't trust your ability to do the job. We will go talk to you, take your ideas, package them nicely, and present them to your boss. And charge your company a small fortune while doing this. If your boss realized that you really are competent, we'd be out of work.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312815.jpg">

3. If you call a drain cleaner to clear your bathtub and all it is just a bit of hair right on the strainer, he will probably just run the snake for 10 minutes to sound busy and charge you full price.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312816.jpg">

4. I'm a housewife. Sometimes I just put dirty dishes in with the clean ones in the dishwasher and run it again so I don't have to unload it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312817.jpg">

5. I work in a medical lab. I see people touch everything without gloves ALL THE TIME. I also see people use their phones with gloves on ALL THE TIME.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312818.jpg">

6. Call Center Agent working for customer service.

We will put you on hold and pretend to ask the supervisor, but actually we will b***h about you.We cannot change company policy for you.

But if you are polite we will try our most to bend the rules for you, because we deal with so many entitled people.

Worst the ones pretending that they are smarter than you and don't really need your help, but desperatly need your help.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312819.jpg">

7. People in the military make wasting time an artform. The sheer amount of hours we spend getting compensated by taxpayers to do *absolutely nothing* is astonishing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312821.jpg">

8. In pest control when we come to spray your place if you demand we spray some areas that legally we are told not to, such as chair cushions, couches, entire doors for example, we’ll straight up fake it and through in some fancy chemical words to make it sound like we did. Sorry but not sorry, we’ll do the best we can cause we know pests can legit be a medical problem and we want nothing more than to help, but we don’t care if you say “just off the books lol” we’re not about to get fined or sued when you get a rash from a pesticide covered chair that you requested. (We don’t care if you don’t care about that, we do and that’s all there is to it)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312822.jpg">

9. A whole lot of IT guys aren't that tech savvy. They just know how to Google well.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312814.jpg">

10. Pricing for custom work is very subjective. Treat us well and we'll figure the price very fairly. Act like a jerk, there are plenty of ways to pad the bill. Start the conversation by demanding a discount and the price goes up 20% before your precious 10% discount comes off.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312823.jpg">

11. The code behind the software/application you’re using is an absolute mess
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312824.jpg">

12. Health insurance.

The squeaky wheel gets the grease. If we refused to cover something for you, COMPLAIN. File a complaint with the Department of Insurance in your state. Complain to your Human Resources department if it’s employer-provided.

So many people accept the first thing they’re told. Don’t. Be aggressive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312813.jpg">

13. I work in construction. I have a lot to say but I’ll leave you with this one; never look behind the walls, in the ceilings, or in any crawl spaces or otherwise tight and infrequently visited places in your house/building, unless you want to find soda and beer cans from decades past.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312825.jpg">

14. I worked at a cheese packaging factory a few years ago. We got big blocks of cheese in, cut them or shredded them, then packaged them for sale. All the same blocks of cheese, but we'd change the film and suddenly it's a different brand.

Next time you go to Walmart and think the more expensive shredded cheese must be higher quality, think again. Just get the store brand. It all came from the same blocks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312826.jpg">

15. The HR may not agree with management's decision either but has to still drive it within the organization. We are employees of the organization just like everyone else, but our performance is evaluated based on other employees.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312827.jpg">

16. For the short time I worked as a financial advisor in training, the reason some people got promotions/better pay than all the other people who were better qualified was due to some people complaining/backstabbing other employees on a daily basis.

Yes, corporate raiding/shark tactics is common and that everyone around you is trying to screw you over/gain an upper hand. Also, don't be surprised by nepotism.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312828.jpg">

17. Call center rep, the more pi**ed off you are, the less we care, and we'll have already forgotten your name the second we answer another call.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312829.jpg">

18. Hotel Front Desk staff here, if you are nice and respectful we will do everything we can to make your stay as enjoyable as possible so you will come back.

If you are an a*****e we don't give two s**ts about you. Bonus points if your a walk-in. Even if we have rooms we will send you elsewhere because we don't want to deal with you.

Edit: I worded part of it poorly, I didn't mean walk ins as a bad thing. I meant people walking in and being an a*****e demanding and being deliberately rude and causing an issue.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312820.jpg">

19. I work in a pharmacy

Yes, we drop some of your pills on the floor, and yes we put them back in your bottle.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312830.jpg">

20. The majority of welders have no certifications, tickets, professional training or qualifications. They just get an opportunity to try it and stick with it.

On a daily basis I see lifting points, holding several tons, welded incorrectly and not tested.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312831.jpg">

21. Nepotism is so regular in manufacturing its not even worth talking about.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312832.jpg">

22. Old school outlaw truckers absolutely do still exist. If you ever have a livestock truck that’s tricked out blow by you doing triple digit speeds at night, he’s waaay overweight and running illegal logs.

Most trucks are lumbering beats of burden, but anything agricultural stopped progressing with the rest of the laws two decades ago.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312833.jpg">

23. Im 19, currently work at a restaurant, you would not believe the amount of s**t talking we do towards customers
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312834.jpg">

24. higher education: many people who are paid specifically for being smart are in fact really dumb.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312835.jpg">

25. The key to being good in sales is convincing the costumer ur not in sales and helping the costumer.

Meaning a lot of non-sales people who help you with certain info (finding the right cellphone, car, insurance company,...) actually know very little on the topic, and aren't trying to find you the best company.

They just are secretly sales people who know a lot about sales and how to trick you into thinking their best pick isn't secretly the company they work for.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312836.jpg">

26. I used to work admin for a hospital and they would purposely overbook patients for appointments in the hope that some would not make it. Whilst this meant that we got through the amount of patients relatively easily, every now and again, the department waiting room (which was basically a corridor with 4 chairs on the side) would be full of pi**ed off patients who are all booked for the same time slot and won't be seen until 2 hours after their arrival.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312837.jpg">

27. If you're a multi-million dollar company, odds are we don't give a s**t about errors under a certain amount of dollars. This is called "materiality", and most auditors rely on the calculation in order to not give a s**t, and get the work done.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312838.jpg">

28. I’m in marketing and write a lot of press releases. Unless someone was actually interviewed by a reporter, every quote you read was written and thought up by someone other than the person allegedly saying it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312839.jpg">

29. At FedEx ground, we can get away with purposely skipping a delivery.

I've held somebody's packages for an extra 5 days because they swerved around me and cut me off in the neighborhood.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312840.jpg">

30. WASH YOUR PRODUCE.

If the guy picking your produce needs to pee, is he going to walk all the way to the outhouse, or is he just going to p**s on one of the many plants around him?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312841.jpg">

31. We don't know how to use the software we make
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312842.jpg">

32. Sometimes I have no f*****g clue why your computer did what it did until I do some research. Majority of my job is reactive. Unless I can change what happened.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312843.jpg">

33. There’s a huge difference between brokers/agents in real estate. Don’t just use a friend or relative because you can. It could mean the difference of thousands of dollars and important information missed.

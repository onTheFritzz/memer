## <a href="#link4" id="link3">25 Red Flags To Know Before Accepting A Job</a>
1. "Having to take an online IQ test before even being considered for an interview."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225005.jpg">

2. "They try to sell you their service during your interview. It was really really bad."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225012.jpg">

3. "The CEO/boss/whatever drives a conspicuously expensive car."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225007.jpg">

4. "If it's a private/family company, do a Google search for '[company name] defendant' and '[company name] plaintiff.' If the company has been sued, or is in the habit of suing others, that can be a red flag - although sometimes there are legit reasons for either. But it's something worth paying attention to."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225008.jpg">

5. "If the company brings alcohol into the office for 'end of week' sessions on a regular basis. I know they can be fun but it's a stupendously bad idea for all kinds of reasons and if leadership hasn't figured that out then I'd think twice before joining."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225010.jpg">

6. "Open interviews. It tells me that people leave faster than you can bring them in, and with good reason."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225019.jpg">

7. "If when you're visiting the company for the first time and you pass someone in a hallway, do they smile and acknowledge your presence with a nod or maybe a hello, or do they ignore you? It's a small thing but very telling about the workplace culture. Similarly, do people seem 'healthy and energized' or 'grey-faced and tired'?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225011.jpg">

8. "To me it was a, "we will start you low and will give you a ton of money later." They never do. Never happens."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225013.jpg">

9. "If the job description has a nondescriptively massive salary range ($25,000-$100,000).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225015.jpg">

10. "Interviewed with a regional vp of a billion dollar company for a sales role. When I asked if the position was a backfill or open due to growth, he stated a backfill. I asked if the person was promoted or moved to a new role, and his response was, “we have had more people quit in 2021 than ever, and it’s because they can’t handle the pressure.” Needless to say, I declined the next step in the hiring process."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225016.jpg">

11. "I know people (rightfully) like to hate on HR, but if a company brags about "not having an HR department to deal with," expect them to be very disorganized at a minimum."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225017.jpg">

12. "Anything that the manager says in the interview that doesn’t line up with the job description."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225014.jpg">

13. "When you don’t get a review until you ask for a raise. Then, all of a sudden, you work is being questioned and you’re being berated."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225018.jpg">

14. "Trying to rush a decision out of you once the offer is made."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225020.jpg">

15. "I always ask the question, "why is this role open? Is it a new role, or am I replacing someone? Why did that person leave?" This really helps you seeing their reaction and if they look nervous it's because the person who left did it because they were not happy."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225021.jpg">

16. "The “sink or swim” technique. It was my first day as a cashier. I got a couple of hours of training, then I was by myself and we were dead. All of a sudden this rush came in and I was asking for help. The manager goes “sink or swim, we’re busy back here, figure it out.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225022.jpg">

17. "If when you are asked to come in for an interview, you are not treated with total respect for your time. For example, if you find yourself waiting for extended periods for an interview because 'so and so is in a really important meeting.' Similarly, if you are not offered at least water and/or coffee if you're in for several interviews. I once interviewed at a place for seven straight hours with no break, no food, not even a glass of water. Fortunately I wasn't offered the job as it was at Michael Milken's firm... before he went to prison."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225009.jpg">

18. "Are you here just for the money?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225023.jpg">

19. "A couple old senior partners, lots of young employees and nothing in between. That means there’s no opportunity to move up, they can’t get people to stay, and can’t get lateral transfers. They work young folks for as long as they can, and the young folks leave once they figure out the company sucks."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225024.jpg">

20. "When an employee quits or gets fired from the job and the company doesn't hire anyone new to replace them. It can be hard to tell as a red flag at first, but the temporary workload they added to your own, on top of what was left after the person quit, slowly becomes your new permanent workload, without any changes to your pay or benefits to compensate for the additional tasks. The further out it goes without the position being filled, the larger and more obvious the red flag becomes."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225006.jpg">

21. "Everybody is very young in a very old company."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225025.jpg">

22. "Competitive pay," but they wont tell you what the pay actually is in the posting or even the interview."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225026.jpg">

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">Guy Learns The Hard Way That Putting Your Dick Into A Vacuum Is A BAD Idea</a>
1.

2. “I don’t know if I’m the only one who has ever thought of doing this, but I had this long running fantasy of sticking my dick into the hose of a vacuum cleaner, turning it on, and having it suck me off. One day, when my entire family went to an event leaving me at home, I decided to seize upon this opportunity and try it out. There were several problems to contend with, however.
The first of these problems was the fact that the wet-dry vac I was using(for fear of what jizz would do to the inside of a dry-only vacuum) wasn’t the cleanest thing in the world. Not only that, but the hose head had a slight lip around it that had become almost jagged from scraping away at the floor. What made this even less comfortable is that I didn’t even have any lubricant, so I just tried to use shampoo to reduce friction.
Sliding it in wasn’t very pleasant, but what I had failed to take into consideration was the fact that my dick wasn’t exactly as wide as the vacuum cleaner hose was, so when I turned the thing on, my dick started violently knocking into the inner wall of the hose.
At this point, my windsock of a dick starts to hurt a little bit. Even still, I decide to try a little harder. That is when I realized my ultimate misstep: I had no idea what to do with the hose to get me off. So, I started in the most natural place to start, which, for me, was rubbing it up and down my shaft. Remember that jagged ring around the end of the hose? Well, I didn’t, at least until I start sliding the hose down, at which point I felt as if a million little knives were cutting into my dick, a problem only exacerbated by the lack of lubrication. Any resistance provided by the shampoo was lost to the suction of the vacuum cleaner.”

3. “At this point, I decided that there was truly no point in continuing, because I was in far too much pain to get off. So, I slid the hose off of my dick before turning the machine off. That was my last mistake. I should have turned the thing off first, because when I was sliding my dick out, it rattled even more violently the less that was in there, to the point where the head was getting bounced like a beach ball against the jagged edge of the hose. That was the worst of the pain for sure.
When I finally recovered my dick from the vacuum cleaner, it was beet red. I had gotten properly tenderized. There were parts that had a little skin scraped off which started to scab shortly thereafter. Between the soreness and the scabbing, I was unable to masturbate for a week, and it was mildly painful for the rest of the month.
TL;DR: Stuck my dick into the hose of a vacuum cleaner to try to get off, got tenderized so bad I was unable to masturbate for the better part of a month. But, hey, at least I didn’t get an infection!”

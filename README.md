## <a href="#link8" id="link7">10 Of The Most Haunted Buildings In the U.S.</a>
1. 1. Myrtles Plantation, St. Francisville, Louisiana - The bayou of southern Lousiana and Mississippi have always held a certain amount of fear for passers through. The Myrtles Plantation was built by General David Bradford in 1796 and is supposedly built above an Native American burial ground. Of the twelve ghost that haunt the property, Chloe the slave who had her ear chopped off for eavesdropping is one of the most infamous. After she poisoned a cake killing the two daughters of her cruel master, she was hung by fellow slaves retribution to themselves by the master was feared. She still walks the Plantation at night wearing a turban to hide her severed ear.

2. 2. Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, Weston, West Virginia - It's never a good idea to visit an abandoned mental asylum, however when it's an asylum as notorious as Trans-Allegheny, it's best just to stay away entirely. Opening in 1864 the facility was only supposed to hold 250 patients, however by the early 1950s that number had climbed to 2,400. The cramped inhumane conditions led to patients growing violent, some patients were even kept in cages. The asylum closed in 1994 but there are still ghost tours available.

3. 3. Winchester Mystery House, San Jose, California - Sarah Winchester was married to the son of the Winchester rifle empire that was the most popular in the world at the time. After her husband and young son died, a seer told Sarah that they were killed by spirits of people that were killed by the Winchester rifles they produced. She claimed the only way to quell the spirits was to continuously build on her victorian home until she died. And that's exactly what she did. The Winchester Mansion has stairs that go to the ceiling, doors that open just to find a brick wall and even secret rooms that are still being discovered.

4. 4. The Sultan's Palace, New Orleans, Louisiana - The French Quarter home was the 1800s resident of a mysterious monster known as "The Sultan", an individual with a taste for wild sex parties, opium, and sex slaves.

5. 5. Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - What was once the most expensive penitentiary in the world, now stands in creepy decay with a few inmates that stayed behind. The Quakers ran the prison and were notoriously strict with their inmates, hooding them whenever they left their cells and with only a skylight for "the light of God" many inmates eventually went mad. The site now does ghost tours and actually has a haunted house every Halloween season named "Terror Behind the Walls".

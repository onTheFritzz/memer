## <a href="#link2" id="link1">20 Dark Secrets People Are More Comfortable Telling Strangers Online Than Their Family</a>
1. My grandma was in a car accident and broke her ankle so she stayed at my house and we took care of her while she recovered. I was entering puberty at the time and discovered that you could order porn on cable and was like a madman ordering porn.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112134/87319154/cable.jpg">

The bill that month came out to $500 my mom thought it was my grandma because her novelas were on like channel 50-60 and the porn was 500-600 lmfaoooo. I’ve literally never told anyone to this day. -pinchefresona
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112130/87319153/camaro.jpg">

2. My uncle owned an old Camaro that collected dust in his garage. When I was around 10 my family and I were in town visiting and I wrote the word “fuck” in the dust on the hood of the car. I used my thumb so that the letters were fatter than my normal index finger. A few hours later my aunt/uncle asked us who did it and I “proved” it wasn’t me by showing how the person who did it had bigger fingers than me. Taking that shit to my grave! -CLToris
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112141/87319155/college.jpg">

3. That I didn't graduate from college. I failed one course my senior year, 2nd semester. The ceremony was already set up so they let everyone walk. I had no diploma in my award...nobody knows to this day and it's been 17 years. Failed one course, 3 credits. Was ashamed so I never went back for those 3 credits. So everyone believes I graduated. -TheLargeYard
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112118/87319151/bank.jpg">

4. I owe the bank $100k. -markoshenov
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112117/87319150/abortion.jpg">

5. It's not my secret, but my mom's. And I'm not hiding it from everyone, just the person who it potentially matters to the most. When my mom was in high school in the 60s, she had a long-term serious boyfriend named Jimmy. They were each other's first, they were together for years, and were planning on getting married. He went away to college, my mom stayed behind, but they were still together. You know what happened next. He cheated and got the new girl pregnant. He comes home to break the news to my mom. Abortion was not legal at the time. He basically says that he wants to be with my mom, but he has no choice but to marry this other girl. My mom was devastated.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112129/87319152/callme.jpg">

Here's the secret: my mom was also pregnant by him, but hadn't told him yet. She decided she wasn't ever going to tell him. Jimmy went on to marry the other girl and never knew my mom was also pregnant. She told me that she later threw herself down a flight of stairs to cause a miscarriage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112142/87319156/churchpoop.jpg">

My mom actually reconnected with Jimmy during the early days of Facebook. She didn't have an account, but asked me to look for him using mine. He was still married to the same person. My mom was married to my dad. They wrote to each other for a while (using my account! ugh!) Signed their messages saying "I Love You."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112144/87319157/elevator.jpg">

My mom passed away a number of years ago. I think about this knowledge I have that Jimmy doesn't. This major life event thing that he doesn't even know happened. That could have changed the trajectory of many lives. I'm certainly not going to tell him. It's not my secret to tell. -kbivs
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112149/87319158/familly.jpg">

6. 'Call me maybe' is my morning alarm. -chilloutjustin777
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112150/87319159/korea.jpg">

7. I had an IBS attack once and had to violently shit in a church grounds behind someone’s car. Used underwear to wipe too and left that there. Not proud. -gotanycrisps
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112151/87319160/ghost.jpg">

8. I sometimes wonder if a bunch of people in an elevator are gonna stab me all at once. -DairyKing28
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112156/87319161/mush.jpg">

9. I would be perfectly ok with never talking to any of my immediate family again. -Dazzling-Toe-4955
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112203/87319162/murderer.jpg">

10. My grandpa was stationed in Okinawa, Japan during the Korean war, while in the Marines. He hooked up with a woman there, and she got pregnant. So, I have a Japanese aunt and a few cousins, in Japan, whom I’ve never met before. -Cardinal270
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112204/87319163/notmarried.jpg">

11. Funny, light hearted story from my childhood. My little brother was in the shower, I could hear him singing. I put a coat on backwards, and a stocking cap pulled over my face, and waited outside the bathroom door. He opened the door (still singing, and dancing kinda), and I did the Frankenstein thing. Arms out, moaning “uhhhh”.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112215/87319167/pornsite.jpg">

He screamed and fell backwards knocking the toilet completely over. Water went everywhere, the top of the toilet tank broke, shower curtain ripped down, and him laying on the floor in the middle of all this. I ran back down the hall; coat and hat off, and sauntered back casually. By then my mother and father and our sisters were there, and everyone is like, you know, what the hell. I’ve heard him tell this story as proof of the existence of ghosts. To this day (little feller is now a 52 year old bank manager with two kids)he believes in ghosts. I don’t feel a bit bad. -Jimmysweetspot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112208/87319164/ones.jpg">

12. My wife is handicapped and I lied to her that I find it hard to clean/cut up mushrooms. She has self esteem issues because I can do things much easily than her. So I lied, and now she feels better. -bukake_attack
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112211/87319165/pest.jpg">

13. One of my closest co-workers, who is an integral part to our very large corporation killed a man in his late teens and threw the body in a lake. He only got off on a technicality. I work remotely so I don’t build a lot of personal relationships with people I work with regularly.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112212/87319166/parenting.jpg">

I googled his full name. It freaked me out at first. But I’ve kinda gotten over it. I wonder if anyone else knows. It happened 40+ years ago. He will retire soon and then I might ask another co-worker about it. I just don’t want to stir the pot. -adamsfan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112219/87319168/plans.jpg">

14. My wife and I aren't officially married. No one knows. We had a ceremony and everything, reception... the whole nine yards. We just never did the official paperwork.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">A Mysterious Box In Grandfather’s Attic Unlocked A 200-Year-Old Secret</a>
1. A few weeks ago, the Lopez family decide to clean their grandfather's attic.

They expected to find some memories of the past, but they couldn't have bargained for what they stumbled upon.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080865.jpg">

2. But to understand this story, you need a bit of context.

When they were children, the grandfather would tell them stories about his father, Ernesto Lopez. According to him, Ernesto had found the pirate Jose Gaspar's treasure in the Hillsborough River.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080866.jpg">

3. They'd always dismissed it as legend -- until they found a box in the attic.

Jose Gaspar was a notorious (and very real) Spanish pirate. Though they knew he was an actual person, they could have never assumed their great-grandfather got ahold of his treasure -- but then recently, they found the box.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080867.jpg">

4. So what was inside?

For starters, they found a crude map of Tampa, likely drawn years ago.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080868.jpg">

5. Here's a drawing of Jose Gaspar, taken from a 1900 brochure.

But the unearthed treasures were about to get even better.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080869.jpg">

6. Yup: They found old Portuguese and Spanish coins, likely from the 1700s.

Visits to numerous antique stores in the area revealed that these coins are the real deal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080870.jpg">

7. Finding real, centuries-old treasure is exciting in and of itself.

But what's that at the top of the box? Could it be what it actually looks like?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080871.jpg">

8. That's right, it's a preserved human hand wearing a ring.

Why their great-grandfather would keep that, they may never know.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080872.jpg">

9. The Lopez family is still trying to make sense of it all.

"Either my great-grandfather made the best, most elaborate pirate hoax ever and never shared it with anyone or he really did find some treasure on the Hillsborough River. There's really no way to know which is the case," Maria Lopez said in an interview.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080873.jpg">

10. No matter the truth, it's a pretty amazing thing to find in an attic.

It also reminds us all that you never know what might be hiding in storage -- so don't just assume it's all dusty Christmas decorations. You could be sitting on a literal treasure!

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">20 Famous People Who Are Truly Talentless</a>
1. Addison Rae. Just an atrocious actress. -DadshipSeries
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123135/87297793/addisonrae.jpg">

2. 6ix9ine. His freestyles are so bad it is crazy. -dududu87
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123138/87297795/6ix9ine.jpg">

3. Has anyone said Elon Musk yet? For sure, that guy. -CharmCity6022
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123141/87297798/elon.jpg">

4. Brooklyn Beckham. He’s professionally quit like three different colleges and design programs. All I know. -Ok_Championship_385
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123140/87297796/brooklynbeckham.jpg">

5. Amy Schumer. Okay, but who actually calls her talented nowadays? It’s pretty well accepted by most people (at least from how it seems online and her Netflix special that was so bad that they got rid of star ratings because of it) that no one likes Schumer. -FedoraChronicles
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123132/87297792/amyschumer.jpg">

6. Dane Cook, who I assume made some deal with the Devil for his early career success, that has since bitten him in the ass. No idea why people thought he was going to become a leading man in Hollywood. -Sometimes_I_Digress
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123140/87297797/danecook.jpg">

7. Big Ed. Hell, he's so untalented, he's famous for his lack of relationship skills/self-awareness. -JustSmileHaHa
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123136/87297794/biged.jpg">

8. Jake Paul, dude made really dumb videos and now he’s claiming he’s a boxer but won’t fight any actual boxers. He’s boxed basketball players and MMA guys whose backgrounds were not boxing. -MonkeyDDeclan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123141/87297799/jakepaul.jpg">

9. Joe Bastianich, from 'MasterChef.' The way he talks down to the contestants is disgusting considering he can only cook one style of food. -Mackooba

13. Pete Davidson. I usually go with comedy is subjective, but I've yet to see anything that dude has done that has even made me chuckle a bit. -rmoore911
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123202/87297806/pete.jpg">

14. Trump. Wasn’t successful in business. Not even impressive in any way in terms of intellect or business acumen or charm. I met him some years before he was the president. Always boggled my mind why people thought he was a successful businessman. The minute I met him I knew he was such a shmuck that had somehow managed to turn his name into a brand. -zankky
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/01/123213/87297810/trump.jpg">

15. DJ Khaled. He really just adds a few beats after saying his name at the beginning of the song. -catkel

17. Piers Morgan is an absolute talentless c*nt who as editor of a sh*t rag newspaper, hacked the phone of a dead child, Millie Dowler and made her parents think she was alive. -gianthaystack

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">30 Facts That Will Change The Way You See The World</a>
1. Pin Number - ATM pins were originally supposed to have six digits. The inventor changed it to four digits, however, because his wife claimed she could only remember that many numbers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286096.jpg">

2. Matches - You would think matches were invented before lighters, right? It only makes logical sense. Wrong. Lighters were made before matches.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286097.jpg">

3. Padlock Hole - Have you ever wondered why there's a hole on the bottom of padlocks? Well, it's there to let water drain out of the lock when it's being used outdoors. This way, the lock won't rust from rain or freeze from cold weather.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286098.jpg">

4. Mattress Bugs - In a course of ten years, an average mattress doubles in weight. All that extra weight comes from an accumulation of dust mite poop and dust mites. Invest in a new bed as often as possible, people!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286099.jpg">

5. T-shirt - Originally invented all the way back in 1904 for bachelors who didn't have a wife or any sewing skills.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286100.jpg">

6. Chocolate Medicine - Chocolate milk nowadays is a beverage we enjoy simply for its delicious taste. But did you know that it was originally sold as medicine by its Irish physician inventor?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286101.jpg">

7. Wine and Champagne Bottle Indentations - The indentations on the bottom of wine and champagne bottles are there to help evenly distribute the pressure of the contents inside the bottle.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286102.jpg">

8. Sugar Free Fib - Tic Tac's claim to be sugar-free when they're actually 98% made of sugar. The FDA doesn't let food label themselves as "sugar-free," unless they have less than .5 grams of sugar per serving. A typical serving size of a Tic Tac is .49 grams.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286103.jpg">

9. Germs - Wearing a ring can be more unsanitary than you think. The number of germs living beneath the ring you're wearing could be equivalent to the entire population of Europe, which is about 730 million.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286104.jpg">

10. Salting Pineapple - Although it sounds weird, adding salt to a pineapple makes it taste sweeter. Don't knock it until you try it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286105.jpg">

11. Gross Office Desk  - It's time to start wiping down your office desk more often. The average office desk has over 400 times more bacteria than an average toilet.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286107.jpg">

12. Fire Hydrant Patent - The owner of the patent for fire hydrants is actually unknown due to the patent office where the records were being held burning down (ironic, we know).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286106.jpg">

13. Directional Travel - If you keep going north, at one point you'll eventually end up going south. If you keep going east, however, you'll never end up west.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286108.jpg">

14. Peanut Butter - One pound of peanut butter can potentially contain 5 rodent hairs and up to 150 bug fragments. It's time to reconsider all those peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286109.jpg">

15. Deadly Beds - Beds are deadlier than you think. In the U.S. alone, 450 people die from falling out of their bed. Be careful when you sleep!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286110.jpg">

16. Mother's Eggs  - Our moms were born already carrying the egg that eventually became us. Isn't that a neat fact?

18. Chocolate Chip Cookie - Ruth Graves, the inventor of the Toll House chocolate chip cookie, sold the idea and her recipe to Nestle in exchange for a lifetime supply of chocolate. Sounds fair enough, right?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286113.jpg">

19. M&M's Origin - Did you know that M&M's were originally created for soldiers in World War II. They were made so that soldiers could carry around chocolate that didn't melt in hot weather (hence the shells on M&M's).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286114.jpg">

20. Zipper Injuries - These injuries happen more often than you think. To be exact, approximately 20,000 folks go to the ER each year for these zipper-involved genital injuries.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286115.jpg">

21. Decreased Life Expectancy - If a person watches 2 hours of television a day, it decreases his or her life expectancy by 1.4 years. Time to watch less tv and save some electricity!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286116.jpg">

22. Barbie's Last Name - Not only does Barbie have a last name, but a middle name as well. Her full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts.

24. Toothpick - The end of a toothpick snaps off easily and makes the perfect little stand, just not for anything too big.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286119.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286120.jpg">

26. Gas Pumps - Have you ever feared of accidentally driving your car off while the gas pump was still attached? Well if it makes you feel any better, driving away with the nozzle still attached won't cause a fireball, explosion, or damage the pump at all! It's designed to break into two pieces due to a metal coupling.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286121.jpg">

27. Bee Orgasm - The male honey bee solely exists to mate with the queen bee. Once the male bee has an orgasm, his testicle explodes and he dies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286122.jpg">

28. Malaria Deaths - The amount of malaria deaths in this world is quite big. It's half of all humans who have ever lived. Now that's a pretty high number.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85286123.jpg">

29. Glowing Tonic  - Tonic water glows in the dark with a blacklight. So turn off the lights and enjoy the free light show!

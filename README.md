## <a href="#link6" id="link5">You May Not Be Eating What You Think You Eat</a>
1. About 99% of all wasabi sold in the US is fake, reports The Washington Post. The vast majority of wasabi consumed in America is simply a mix of horseradish, hot mustard, and green dye.

True wasabi is difficult to grow and extraordinarily expensive, costing $160 a kilogram at wholesale prices. If you're eating real wasabi, you're consuming the stem of a plant, grated and pulverized into a spicy paste. It reportedly has a more complex taste, but needs to be eaten immediately — within 15 minutes, the freshly grated wasabi begins to lose its signature flavor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85273716.jpg">

2. Lobsters

More than one-third of restaurants, including Red Lobster, swap out lobster for more inexpensive substitutes in their dishes, reports Inside Edition. In February, the news organization ran DNA tests on lobster dishes from 28 restaurants across the country. Thirty-five percent of the samples contained cheaper seafood, such as whiting and langostino.

While langostino means "little lobster" in Spanish, the crustacean is more similar to a hermit crab — and less expensive than American lobsters.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85273717.jpg">

3. Kobe beef

While restaurants across the US offer menu items like the Cheesecake Factory's "Kobe burgers" and pricey "Kobe steaks," the vast majority of these claims are false. Only eight restaurants in the entire US serve real Kobe beef.

Since Kobe beef costs more than $20 an ounce, if you're purchasing something that is supposedly made of Kobe beef and isn't absurdly expensive, you're probably being scammed.

4. Parmesan cheese

In February, Bloomberg News tested store-bought grated cheeses for cellulose, revealing that all of the cheeses — called 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese — tested contained the anti-clumping additive made of wood pulp.

While cellulose is a safe additive, an acceptable level is 2% to 4%, according to cheese technologist Dean Sommer. Cheese makers often mix in higher levels of the wood pulp when making cheese because it is less expensive than pure Parmesan.

5. Red snapper

According to an expert involved in DNA species testing, 94% of the time you order fish labeled red snapper, it is actually a different fish.

A rule of thumb: If the fish is expensive and you haven't seen it displayed whole, there's a good chance it's an imitation. And even then, it's hard to differentiate between wild-caught and farmed fish.

6. Truffles

Real truffles are trendy, prized, and extremely rare. If it's not shaved in front of you, your truffle is likely simply a chemical combination — especially if it's marketed as "truffle oil."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85273721.jpg">

7. Olive oil

Fake versions of olive oil are extraordinarily common, with retailers passing off other seed oils, including soybean oil, peanut oil, and sunflower-seed oil, as the real thing.

Consuming fake olive oil can have serious health consequences, such as a 1981 case in Spain where 20,000 people consumed so-called olive oil that was in fact rapeseed oil, containing a poisonous toxin called aniline.

8. Honey

More than 75% of the honey sold in US grocery stores contains ingredients other than pure honey, reports Food Safety News. Honey is frequently "watered down" and cut with corn or fructose syrup to decrease costs. 

Further, some retailers mislabel certain types of honey as a more expensive and popular types, such as manuka honey, to hike up prices.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">Detachable Jeans Prove The Fashion Industry Is Just Ridiculous</a>
1. It would appear that 2017 will be the year that fashion declared a war on jeans. After the ridiculous clear plastic jeans debacle, and then the jeans with a zipper on the butt, it seems like people just can't leave the poor denim alone.

Oh, but they're not done.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359312.jpg">

2. Now Opening Ceremony is trying to make “detachable cut-out front jeans” happen, and it’s up to us to stop it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359313.jpg">

3. Designed by Y/Project, they can be worn as full-length trousers, with your under-butt and groin exposed.

“These 2-in-1 Y/Project trousers come in a straight-leg silhouette with slim-fitting, detachable shorts that feature high-rise cutouts along the front,” reads Opening Ceremony’s product description.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359314.jpg">

4. One word: CLASSY.

But if you’re feeling extra bold, you can detach the legs of the jeans and wear them as denim shorts. Don’t forget the heels, apparently.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359315.png">

5. The kicker?

These bad boys will set you back a whopping $425.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359316.png">

6. But for the low price of $424.99, I will personally cut the ass out of your jeans for you.

What a steal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359317.jpg">

7. Behold a pair of jeans that unzip down your butt crack.As part of its partnership with Levis, Vetements has come out with its new pair of “high-rise distressed” jeans. Nothing in that title alludes to the zipper down your butt crack, but there it is.

You can’t really miss it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359318.jpg">

8. Just in case you were wondering, the jeans also have zippers going down the back of the leg as well.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85359320.jpg">

9. Vetements is one of the major “tastemakers” in fashion, which is why it’ll get away with selling these new zipper-heavy jeans for $1,870.This look doesn’t come cheap.
If the jeans appear too constricting despite the air for your derriere, there is also a shorts version.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">30 of the Tiniest Things People Got Offended Over</a>
1. Had someone get offended by me calling my brother "bro". They insisted that I was racist and that white people can't be related to Mexicans.

Like seriously lady. That's not how genetics work. We are 100% related and are a mix of white and Native American. Its not that unheard of for one biological sibling to come out lighter or darker than the other.

And even if we weren't related... Seriously? I'm racist for calling someone close to me my bro despite being different skin tones? Seriously?

Thank you for coming to my rant session. Have a good day.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319570.jpg">

2. I once listened to my boss try to lecture the Fire Marshall because he was talking about something being flame retardant (her reasoning was you should just call it fireproof because retardant was an awful word.). It was one of those times where I really should have tried to stop her but instead I just stood off to the side probably making a surprised pikachu face.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319593.jpg">

3. I am a disabled person. My life sucks because of my disability and no longer being able to do the things I used to love makes me quite depressed sometimes. Some a*****e tried to lecture me about how I was ableist for wishing there was a cure for my disability. F**k me for not enjoying being in constant pain and possibly ending up in a wheelchair in the future I guess.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319571.jpg">

4. People get very offended that I don't like being touched.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319572.jpg">

5. This guy at a Halloween party I was at was dressed in a giant bacon costume.

Some girl was *yelling* at him for being so offensive toward Jews and Muslims (she was neither Jewish nor Muslim). One of the Muslim guys at the party asked her what the f**k she was talking about but she didn't back down lol

I have no idea why people feel they need to go out of their way to be (inaccurately) offended on behalf of other cultures/religions
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319573.jpg">

6. One time someone got offended when I put on my seatbelt, thought I was commenting on her ability to drive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319574.jpg">

7. At my wedding we marked the vegetarian items as vegetarian. This made the one vegetarian at my wedding (sister in law who hates me) fly into a catatonic rage because we are singling out the vegetarian food as vegetarian and not treating it as normal food. Then how the f**k are they supposed to know its vegetarian?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319575.jpg">

8. Sporks.

I once heard someone say, *"The spork is 'the devil's utensil' because it is the amalgamation of the masculine fork and the feminine spoon and is trying to blur gender lines in society."*
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319576.jpg">

9. A sandwich. I kid you not. My Ex husband was given a sandwich by our then 13yr old daughter and because she cut the sandwich he went off on a massive strop about how his sandwiches should never be cut etc. The poor kids face, she was crushed. It still winds me up no end every time I think about it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319577.jpg">

10. _Happy holidays_ successfully triggered an entire demographic. I'm still amazed by it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319578.jpg">

11. I told my my sister in a PM that it’s “1st” not “1rst” after she posted something on Facebook with the spelling error. She flipped out saying how I’m a “bully” and I need to “appreciate that her spelling is more unique”.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319579.jpg">

12. Using a walking stick. I was in a car accident a few years ago and it f****d my leg up. Since then i've been using a walking stick. I was walking to shop (pre-pandemic) and an old bloke gave me the dirtiest look i've ever seen.

"What do you need a cane for? you're only a kid..."

He actually got quite pissy just seeing me using a stick. Like, my dude, i'm just out trying to buy some milk, i don't need your s**t today. (i didn't say that out loud, i just said it to myself after i got home)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319580.jpg">

13. Maybe 22 years ago, I had a phone interview with a baking company. I didn’t care to have my peers know what I was up to so I took the call on my cell phone in my car. The call was crystal clear and no technical issues.

At one point, they had mentioned the weather and asked how it was where I was. I told him that I was sitting in my car and I could see that it was actively snowing and what not. The interviewer asked me, “are you taking this call on a cell phone?”
I told him I was. Then he asked me if I thought that was appropriate. I asked him what he meant by that. He said he thought it was kind of rude to take a formal call on a cell phone. I told him I would be more than happy to conclude the interview if talking on a cell phone was an issue. If he was interested, I’d be happy to continue it the next day when I’d be at a desk. He again repeated how rude he thought it was that I had called from a cell phone and that there was no need to continue the interview process. I disagreed with the first point but did agree with the second.

To this day, I wonder what the hell he was talking about and where he was coming from.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319581.jpg">

14. I worked at a restaurant and we put up some Halloween decorations. We had to take them all down when someone found the glittery skull decoration offensive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319588.jpg">

15. It's specific to France. In french we have a way to address for a man (Monsieur), a married woman (Madame), an unmarried woman (Mademoiselle) and we use to have one for an unmarried man (Mondamoiseau) wich disappeard from official paperworks since i don't even know when.

In the name of gender equality, "mademoiselle" was also removed a few years ago from official paperwork. Also in the name of gender equality some employee were told to not call young women "Mademoiselle" anymore and to go with "Madame".

So the trick is, some women will get offended when called "Madame" because it makes them feel old and some women will get offended when called "Mademoiselle" because it's sexist. Clerks a doomed.

16. >Professor Greg Patton at the University of Southern California (USC) was telling students in a communications lecture last month about filler, or pause words, such as 'err', 'umm' or 'you know' in English.
>
>Footage of his lecture, which has now gone viral, shows Prof Patton saying: "In China, the common pause word is 'that, that, that'. So in China, it might be na-ge, na-ge, na-ge."
>
>Enunciated, na-ge sounds like the N-word, which led several of the professor's students to complain to the university. Responding to the complaint, the dean of the university, Geoffrey Garrett, told students that Prof Patton would no longer be teaching the course.
>
>"It is simply unacceptable for the faculty to use words in class that can marginalize, hurt and harm the psychological safety of our students," he said.
>
>The university says that Prof Patton "volunteered to step away" from his role amid the investigation into complaints made against him.

This is the stupidest thing to get offended over that I've seen in quite a while. And damaging to actual cases of racist terminology being used inappropriately.

17. When I was a child, my mum paid for something with a cheque. The cashier remarked that my mum had nice hand writing
My mum flew off the handle, and we had to storm out of the shop in outrage.
To this day, I have no idea what happened.

18. One of my coworkers was surprised and said “Oh my god”.

A religious coworker overheard her using ‘god’s name in vain’ and reported it to HR. They had to have meetings with HR and the managers about respecting people’s religion. The lady said ‘oh my god’ she didn’t wish for the death of Christianity for f**k’s sake! It was ridiculous.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319584.jpg">

19. I got in trouble in kindergarten for saying the word dead. Apparently it was too violent.

20. I was at the vet with my cat and he sneezed. This was apperently very offensive to an elder woman (she was there with a corgi) and she started screaming at me for about 30 minutes about pet hygiene.

21. wearing a mask in public

22. We used an app at work called Bonfyre. One person refused to use it because bonfires are for witchcraft and pagans.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319589.jpg">

23. When I worked in customer service:


"Yes ma'am"

...

"don't you ma'am me. don't you F*****G MA'AM ME YOU PIECE OF S**T!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319590.jpg">

24. I had a coworker who got mad at me because I asked her not to tickle me.

(a) That's inappropriate at work; (b) we're not children, we're not in a relationship, we're not family; (c) I DON'T LIKE BEING TICKLED.

She flipped out and said everyone likes being tickled and I was being mean to her. Happily my boss had my back.

Edit: this happened over a decade ago, I don't work with that woman or for that company. In fact, even the company doesn't exist anymore.

I am also a woman.

The coworker was very young and immature. This was her first job, her first time in a professional environment, and she really had no clue about professional workplace behavior. I wasn't upset because she truly thought she was being friendly.

But I still don't like being tickled.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319591.jpg">

25. My dad loves to tell the story of how, shortly after they were married, he and mom went to get some fast food. As they pulled up to the drive through window, my very conservative mom saw a sign that said "Condiments available upon request" and said "OMG, that's disgusting! WHY would a restaurant feel the need to give those out!?" She had misread it and thought they were giving out condoms upon request.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319592.jpg">

26. The guy who got offended in a council meeting because someone used the term "black hole".
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319594.jpg">

27. I spent 9 hours deep-cleaning the house for an inspection. I went above and beyond, clearing my work schedule and going the extra mile, and my roommate “double checked” my work. He had a complete psychotic meltdown because I forgot to sweep *underneath* the couch.

I moved out the next day and never spoke to him again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319595.jpg">

28. My mom got mad because and I quote "she never asks me for money" referring to me. I'm sorry, would you rather I constantly bug you for cash so I can buy candy and s**t?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319596.jpg">

29. The Pixar short Lava. He walked out saying it was deeply offensive and didn't explain why.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319597.jpg">

30. One Easter Sunday, a lady in church was wearing a hat that had the Easter Bunny, chicks, and colored eggs as part of its design.

The woman in the pew behind her took umbrage, telling the lady that Easter was about the *resurrection of Jesus from the dead*, not about "silly rabbits, chicks, and eggs."

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">23 Useful Facts That Might Save You in a Pinch </a>
1. If you find yourself stranded in a desert, ration sweat, not water. Of course don’t drink all of your water in one go, but the rate a which you’ll dehydrate and overheat if exerting yourself (e.g. walking/hiking too fast or climbing over obstacles in the heat of the day) will kill you much quicker. Many people are found dead, with water, which is terrifying. -u/kfnola
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87267488.jpg">

2. Point at someone and delegate. People freeze up in emergencies or assume someone else will handle a problem. Point at someone as say 'you guy in the blue shirt. Go to the gate and tell the ambulance where we are. Ma'am? please go with him.' Don't ask 'does anyone know CPR.' Point at someone and ask if they do. Even if they don't people are more likely to step forward in fear of being asked next and judged for not acting sooner then volunteering from the beginning. -u/Polyfuckery

3. If you are trying to rescue someone, check for danger first and maintain your own safety! In a lot of situations, it's easy for untrained first responders to become a casualty themselves in the heat of the moment trying to help others.Source: I'm a nurse and I've seen this happen a lot, particularly with drownings. -u/CaffeineYAY

5. Not too crazy but if someone is acting drunk but didn't have any alcohol, ask them to smile, if one side of their mouth is down, take them to a doctor cause they are having or will have a stroke. -u/Simecrafter
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87267489.png">

6. If you're choking, don't get embarrassed, don't go to the bathroom, don't walk away from people. I've seen a couple people nearly die because they were panicking and walked away from the dinner table(s) and such while choking.Do the universal sign for choking with both your hands on your neck, and most people will get the message. -u/Kat-is-sorry

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87267499.jpg">

16. When performing CPR, chest compressions need to be continuous, deep and fairly quick.Call for an ambulance first. If you can get someone to help you, do so, because it is exhausting.For an adult, good quality chest compressions should be two per second and 5-6cms deep.You should lock your hands together one on top of the other, get your arms straight, lock your elbows and push with the heel of your bottom hand into the middle of the chest...HARD. And you do not stop until help arrives.The rumor that chest compressions can crack ribs is true, but trust me, they'd rather have broken ribs than be dead. -u/Fluid_Assignment837

17. If someone ODs, don’t wait to discuss or figure out if you/they will “get in trouble.” Every minute counts and if staff ask if they took anything, tell them immediately.Tests will reveal it anyway, but every minute they have to run them is another minute they can’t treat the patient correctly. Do not hesitate to call emergency services for a suspected overdose, as quick and treatment and response is imperative.They’re not the police, they’re not out to get anyone in trouble and if it messes with something like their doctor’s prescriptions, it’s preferable to leave them to die. If you do any kind of opiates or have people at your house who do often, have naloxone handy and know how to administer it. -u/Odimorsus

19. If you need to check a pressurized line(ex: hydraulic line), never ever use your hand, use a piece of cardboard or soapy water. If you use your hand to check, the pressure can cause the fluid to cut your skin, and liquids like hydraulic fluid WILL cause gangrene in a matter of hours. Go to the hospital immediately and get them to check you right away, don't take no for an answer! It could mean the difference between keeping vs losing your limb. -u/OldManAndTheBench
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87267505.jpg">

20. Sucking out snake venom doesn’t work. If you’ve been bitten by a venomous snake, take a clear picture from a distance and call an ambulance immediately. The picture will be used to identify the snake species in order to get the most effective antivenin. Edit: I answer why, despite having CROFAB (universal antivenin), narrowing down the species aids in treatment.This will especially save your life: if you see a venomous snake, do not approach to kill it or relocate it! This how people get bitten. Spray it with water and it should leave, or, wait 30 minutes and it will be gone. Getting close to a venomous snake with the intent to kill it is how you will get bitten.If you see a snake you can’t identify 100% - if there is even the slightest possibility you don’t know - DONT pick it up. (This is surprisingly common) -u/Kooky-Copy4456

21. If you ever have to rescue a drowning person, throw them something to grab onto beside yourself. -u/jump_the_shark_
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87267507.jpg">

22. When you see someone faint, DON'T help him stay up. Gently catch and lay down asap. They're fainting because the brain needs blood to stay alive, keeping them upright will prevent this.If you feel light-headed, lay down so that no dumbass will try to keep you on your feet. If you suffer from any condition that causes fainting, explain this to people around you. -deleted user

1. “I decided to pull back for a second to regain my composure. I thought if I pulled open her lady-bits I might be able to have a better angle of attack on her clit. I opened up her pussy to a terrible sight. There were multiple lumps of what looked like cottage cheese dotted around her pussy lips and clit.Each lump ranged from a few millimeters in width to half a centimeter in size. It looked like some sort of fungus was growing there.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468177.jpg">

2. “He pulled it out to come on my face, I was unprepared and snorted his semen up my nose. We started making out and I sneezed his semen onto his own face.”

3. “One Saturday afternoon, the boy is performing some world class cunnilingus when I feel a pressure at my nether orifice. I soon realized he was using some beads on me. We had some filthy and very very satisfying sex, then I went to the bathroom to clean up without removing the beads. I sat on the toilet to get the beads out. Those beads were solidly embedded in a great big turd. I just stared at it dumbly for a moment before the smell hit me.”

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468180.gif">

5. “A girl I had been dating for awhile climbed on me for 69. As she scooted back, I saw something white, realized too late that it was a clump of toilet paper, and got it in my mouth. Pretty nasty, but I spit it out and kept going.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468181.jpg">

6. “Having sex with my wife, and then noticing that something didn’t feel quite right, she still had a tampon in from 4 days prior…and i had to help pull it out….”

7. “Sucking a chicks nipple in the dark. She was loving it. All of a sudden there is liquid.. Lactating.. sick. So keep going, she seems to be loving it. Lights come on, dun dun dunnn, I had been sucking the pus out of a boil.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468183.jpg">

8. “Last summer my husband and I were living with roommates who had a cat. We were drinking and started getting hot and heavy, he stripped down and jumped on the bed, said something about it being wet and jumped back up. One of us had left our bedroom door cracked and the cat had gotten stuck in the room, and pooped all over our bed. Worse is that apparently this cat was sick with worms. My poor husband was covered in kitty diarrhea, blood and worms.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468184.gif">

9. “The grossest sexual encounter I’ve had was a guy who sweat so profusely it was dripping on me, then he flipped his sweaty ass around into my face to attempt what I can only assume was a 69 position but was more like being force fed a butt sandwich and I could see the sweat glistening on his ass/ball hair, that, and the cheese smell coming from his balls made my eyes water and I threw him off me and ran to the shower.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468185.jpg">

10. “She smelled really horrible, and she tasted even worse. He didn’t want to offend her though because he hadn’t seen her in months…so he put a Jolly Rancher in his mouth to cover it up, even though it didn’t do much to help. In the course of eating her out, he accidentally pushed the candy inside of her… and stuck a finger in to grab it out. He took it out, and put it back into his mouth and bit it. Only…it wasn’t the Jolly Rancher. It was a nodule of gonorrhea.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468186.gif">

11. “So this one time I’m having sex with my girlfriend right, and it was all good and sexy so we finish up and everything seems cool.Then about 9 months later a fucking little human being comes out of her pussy! I mean just like pops out and I saw that shit with my own eyes! The little fucker is still living with us.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468187.jpg">

12. “Anal sex. Pinworms. Maybe not as gross as the OP’s story, but it’s fucking nasty to pull your dick out and see a dozen or so worms writhing around on the condom.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468188.gif">

13. “Suddenly, in one swift move, she pounced me, knocked me onto my back, jumped on top of me, spun around and started sucking me off, 69 style. I was totally into it, and started reciprocating. Only a few moments pass before I felt a tap on my forehead. My face was fully between her legs, yet there was this tap tap tap on my forehead. Every couple of seconds, tap tap tap. This tapping continued and started to take me out of the moment. I pried my face from between her legs to get a better view of what was going on. To my horror, I witnessed, dangling from her asshole, a fucking tape worm, bouncing like a fettuccine noodle with every excited movement she made.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85468189.jpg">

14. “I once had a 69 with a girl, and about halfway through it, I felt something fall down my throat. I threw her off and ran to the bathroom. It was about a half-inch glob of congealing, jelly-like burnt-red… blood.”

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">21 Fast Food Employees Reveal The Food You Should Never Order</a>
1. If you see something on the menu and can’t find at least one or two other items that the ingredients could be used in, don’t order it.For example, my restaurant has a pulled pork sandwich. We don’t use the pork for anything else. Since it’s not ordered too frequently, it’s not fresh and the product you’re eating might be days or weeks old. It’s not going to get you sick, but it definitely won’t be as fresh as the other things on the menu.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287286.jpg">

2. I used to work at chipotle, and never ever ever order the Tacos. You get less than half the regular portions. Instead, order a bowl with whatever you want in it, then ask for the taco shells, hard or soft, on the side. When I was there, the shells were free to get on the side.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287287.jpg">

3. Tuna sandwiches. 80% mayonnaise.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287288.jpg">

4. I work at a Buffalo Wild Wings. Don’t get anything other than the wings. That’s the only quality thing there. Everything else is frozen shit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287289.jpg">

5. Worked at KFC for ~4 years. The BBQ sandwich is actually made from chicken too old and stale to give to the homeless shelters, so they soak it in BBQ sauce until it can be pulled and then they keep it on the heater for a month.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287290.jpg">

6. I used to work at 7-11, so i’m gonna say any of the taquitos or hotdogs around midnight, up through about 4 or 5AM. around midnight you can be almost assured that these are now high-mileage. That hotdog might have more miles than your car.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287291.jpg">

7. Don’t order the salad. We have to add a butt-load of fatty ranch dressing and fried chicken to cover up the taste of the vile, old iceberg lettuce.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287292.jpg">

8. At our subway, The “oven roasted” chicken was actually boiled in a microwave.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287293.jpg">

9. Jimmy John’s…If you’re trying to order a healthy option, don’t order the Gourmet Veggie Club. It’s the second most caloric sandwich behind something called the “Gargantuan”. 8 slices of provolone cheese will do that.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287294.jpg">

10. Starbucks — don’t order something from the “secret menu”. We sure as shit don’t know what a Snickerdoodle frappuccino is, as it is not a menu item. Employees would be more than happy to make you a drink if you just explain the recipe rather than the name of it. I’ll make you diabetes in a goddamn cup if you just tell me what you want in there. Just don’t get mad at me for not knowing a whole menu customers created.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287295.jpg">

11. Anything egg related after breakfast ends. They keep a very small amount warm after breakfast and it tends to get old fast.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287296.jpg">

12. I used to work at Boston Market. They’re pretty good. The only thing I can think of is that any chicken that isn’t on the bone (sandwich, pot pie, etc) is day old, or more, leftover chicken.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287297.jpg">

13. All Starbucks food is reheated frozen food. Ridiculous how little people realize that. Doesn’t mean it doesn’t taste good, it’s just not fresh at all and incredibly overpriced.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287298.jpg">

14. KFC. Literally anything.The potatoes are powdered potatoes, the gravy is powdered gravy, the corn and green beans come from Green Giant, at least they used to. Now idk where they come from but the green beans taste like shit now.Tenders. Used to be made fresh every order. Now they’re pre battered and stuck in a cooler. Sure, frozen chicken is frozen chicken, and KFC only serves frozen chicken, but when the tenders were fresh with every order and the fryer oil was recently changed, that was peak KFC.Mac and Cheese is microwaved now. Used to be baked. Guess that took too long.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287299.jpg">

15. I’ve worked at 4 restaurants in my life and lemons and ice are by far the most disgusting things you can get” The skin of a lemon contains several thousand pours that can hold bacteria. If the lemons are not carefully washed prior to use, there is a chance that bacterial can make its way into your water.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287300.jpg">

16. I used to work in a baseball park concession stand. The short answer is not to order anything, but if you absolutely have to buy something, don’t buy the hotdogs.Do not. Buy. The Hot Dogs.They made it out of the package okay, and might even have been edible after we finished grilling them – and then they went into the water. We kept three pans of water at the back of the grill that held the hot dogs. Any hot dogs left at the end of the day went back into the fridge, and came out again the next day. Me and the other cook put our feet down on throwing out the water and old hotdogs after two full days, but the management didn’t want to let us.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287301.jpg">

17. I used to work at Wendy’s. The meat used in the chili, yeah that comes from the meat on the grill top that expires and dries up that’s put in to a warming drawer until you have enough for a batch of chili, which we first freeze and then thaw the next day. Also if the chili sitting in the warmer doesn’t sell fast enough we just added hot water to it to mix it up.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287302.jpg">

18. Panera – pasta; it’s all microwaved, this includes Mac and cheese. Smoothies/frozen drinks- nasty base crap that smells and it’s sticky. Cupcakes/coffee cakes- all come frozen. Best items are the real sandwhich/ salads. Real ingredients and usually fresh.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287303.jpg">

19. If you’re really short on time, don’t count on chicken tenders or grilled chicken sandwiches or salads being made quickly at Burger King. I remember that the tenders took forever to cook and we didn’t really make them that often, so most times they were made to order. Same for the grilled chicken.Everything else is whatever, I mean, still shitty because it’s burger King but the normal amount of shitty.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287304.jpg">

20. I work for McDonald's and make sure everyone that matters to me never orders anything that comes out of the ‘McCafe’ machine as these are routinely neglected, in practically all the McDonalds. Not only are staff not properly trained in its cleaning and maintenance, at almost every McDonalds I’ve had experience with, the managers in charge of training them don’t know fuck all either…All McCafe beverages run through a horrifically dirty machine – we’re talking 5+ inches of uncleaned, liquid bullshit making up its inside parts
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87287305.jpeg">

21. I worked at taco bell a little bit ago and I warn everyone to stay away from both the beans, and the steak. The beans start out looking like cat food, and the directions are, ‘Add water and stir until you can’t see white anymore.’ The steak was just the worst on dish duty. If it would sit too long it would become like hair gel. It was the worst.

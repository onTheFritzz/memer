## <a href="#link1" id="link0">15 Classic 90s Toys That Will Make You Feel Like A Kid Again</a>
1. Super Soaker - This was THE water gun of the 90s. This was from a time where playing with fake guns of the water variety was encouraged, and if you didn’t have one of these, you were SOAKED.

2. Moonshoes - Have you ever been to the moon? Me neither, but I have used these fucking things, so I’ve been closer to the moon than all these Millennials.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168573.jpg">

3. Power Wheels - Not many kids had these, and if you lived on a big hill, good luck, but those few spoiled brats that had one, knew it was the shit! These things took playing outside with your friends to the next level, my neighbor had the fire truck one, we put out so many infernos on that thing.

4. Gak - This was the Silly Puddy of the 90s. Parents hated it, cause you could make fart sounds by pushing it into its case, and also it could make a pretty big mess if put on carpet, couches, or pretty much any fabric. So obviously kids loved it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168574.jpg">

5. Nerf Turbo Screamer - What would a 90s list be without a Nerf football? The answer is incomplete. While technically made in 1989, this ball was a 90s standard. You could throw it far, and it was easy to catch, and if you knew when you threw it just right thanks to that amazing whistle!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168585.jpg">

6. Micro Machines - From the fast talking dude in the commercials to the sheer number of different cars and accessories, micro machines did a great job of always making kids want more! The quality of the cars and products also seemed to be held to a high standard.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168581.gif">

7. Lazer Tag - More fun with guns in the 90s. Lazer Tag ruled, the version I remember was made by Sharper Image, also a dope store to go in and play with a bunch of shit your parents couldn’t afford. This was a hard to attain toy to play with, but it was fun as hell if you ever got the chance.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168577.jpg">

8. Game Boy - Nintendo was the king of gaming in 90s. With this bad boy you could take your games on trips and even play them in your bedroom while you were supposed to be sleeping. It had a massive selection of games, Battletoads was a personal favorite.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168576.jpg">

9. Boglins - While technically this toy that came out in 1987, it has a real 90s feel to it. The packaging was genius, you could raise and lower the gate, and also control the Boglin from the hole under the cage. The eyes glowed in the dark and could be moved from the puppet mechanism inside. These fucking ruled!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168583.jpg">

10. Talk Boy - Just imagine this, a toy that let you record your voice, then play it back faster or slower!! AMAZING! This device seems completely archaic looking back on it today, when we all have HD video cameras on our phones and apps that can distort video and audio in pretty much any way you can imagine. But back in the day, kids played with this thing and loved it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168578.jpg">

11. Trolls - Fuck these little shits. Just think if I invested my allowance money as a kid on Apple Stock instead of these fucking things. For some reason, I was addicted to wasting my money on these…SMH.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168579.jpg">

12. Koosh - This is basically a remixed rubber band ball. It was marketed towards kids who liked bright colors, so I was in. While it certainly was a kids toy, the center was hard as shit if it pegged you in the nose, and had the capabilities to dish out a mean nose blead…I’m speaking from personal experience.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168580.jpg">

13. Switchblade Combs - So badass. Not only did other kids fear you, but the ladies were into your always perfectly combed hair. Double the trouble.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168582.jpg">

14. McDonald’s McDino Changeables - These awesome transforming McDonalds toys were actually pretty easy to attain back in the day. They came in kids meals at Mcdonalds, in the early 90s. They were pretty fun to play with and trade with your friends.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/697157/85168584.jpg">

15. Ghostbusters Toys - These toys ranged from action figures, to guns, to proton packs, to hologram projectors, there was a seemingly unlimited amount of ghostbusters shit you could waste money on. But playing with the stuff was actually pretty fun, cause you could pretend to be Bill Murray.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">20 Of The Most Sadistic Torture Methods Ever Devised</a>
1. HANGED, DRAWN AND QUARTERED.

During medieval times, the penalty for high treason in England was to be hanged, drawn and quartered in public and though it was abolished in 1814, it has been responsible for the death of thousands of people. In this torture technique, the victim is dragged in a wooden frame called a hurdle to the place of execution. They would then be hanged by the neck for a short period of time until they are near-death (hanged), followed by disembowelment and castration where the entrails and genitalia are burned in front of the victim (drawn). The victim would then be divided into four separate parts and beheaded (quartered).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274016.jpg">

2. THE BRAZEN BULL.

Also known as the Sicilian Bull, it was designed in ancient Greece. A solid piece of brass was cast with a door on the side that could be opened and latched. The victim would be placed inside the bull and a fire set underneath it until the metal became literally yellow as it was heated. The victim would then be slowly roasted to death all while screaming in agonizing pain. The bull was purposely designed to amplify these screams and make them sound like the bellowing of a bull.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274017.jpg">

3. SAW TORTURE.

In this method, the victim is hung upside down, so that the blood will rush to their heads and keep them conscious during the long torture. The torturer would then saw through the victims’ bodies until they were completely sawed in half. Most were cut up only in their abdomen to prolong their agony.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274018.jpg">

4. THE CHAIR OF TORTURE.

Also known as the Judas Chair, it was a terrible, intimidating torture device that was added to dungeons in the Middle Ages. Used until the 1800′s in Europe, this chair was layered with 500 to 1,500 spikes on every surface with tight straps to restrain its victim. Made of iron, it can also contain spaces for heating elements beneath the seat. It was often used to scare people into giving confessions as they watched others being tortured on the device.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274019.jpg">

5. THE RACK. 

Is a torture device consisting of a rectangular, usually wooden frame, slightly raised from the ground, with a roller at one or both ends. The victim’s ankles are fastened to one roller and the wrists are chained to the other. As the interrogation progresses, a handle and ratchet mechanism attached to the top roller are used to very gradually increase the tension on the chains, inducing excruciating pain. By means of pulleys and levers this roller could be rotated on its own axis, thus straining the ropes until the sufferer’s joints were dislocated and eventually separated. Additionally, if muscle are stretched excessively, they lose their ability to contract, rendering them ineffective. One gruesome aspect of being stretched too far on the rack is the loud popping noises made by snapping cartilage, ligaments or bones.

6. BREAST RIPPER.

Known in another form as the Iron Spider or simply the spider, was a torture instrument mainly used on women who were accused of adultery, or self-abortion. The instrument was designed to rip the breasts from a woman and was made from iron, which was usually heated. The tool was used popularly in the Free State of Bavaria, a state in Germany, in 1599, and in parts of Germany and France until the nineteenth century.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274021.jpg">

7. TONGUE TEARER.

Looking like an over sized pair of scissors, it could effortlessly cut the victim’s tongue. Their mouth would be forced opened with a device called a mouth opener, and then the iron tongue tearer would uncomfortably twitch the tongue with its rough grippers. Once a firm hold was maintained, the screw would be firmly tightened and the victim’s tongue would roughly be torn out.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274022.jpg">

8. IRON MAIDEN.

This torture device consisted of an iron cabinet with a hinged front and spike-covered interior, sufficient enough to enclose a human being. Once inside its conical frame, the victim would be unable to move due to the great number of steel spikes impaling them from every direction. The interrogator would scream questions at the victim while poking them with jagged edges.

9. STRAPPADO.

The Strappado is a form of torture in which the victim’s hands are first tied behind his or her back and suspended in the air by means of a rope attached to wrists, which most likely dislocates both arms. Weights may be added to the body to intensify the effect and increase the pain. Other names for strappado include “reverse hanging” and “Palestinian hanging” (although it is not used by the Palestinian Authority) It is best known for its use in the torture chambers of the medieval Inquisition.

10. WOODEN HORSE/SPANISH DONKEY.

One of the torture devices during the Spanish Inquisition and medieval ages, this is probably one of the most gruesome of them all. The victim is put astride, naked, on a donkey-like apparatus, which is actually a vertical wooden board with a sharp V-wedge on top of it. After that, the torturer would add varying weights to the victim’s feet until finally the wedge sliced through the victim’s body.

11. PEAR OF ANGUISH/CHOKE PEAR.

The pear of anguish or choke pear is the modern name for a type of instrument displayed in some museums, consisting of a metal body (usually pear-shaped) divided into spoon-like segments that could be spread apart by turning a screw. The museum descriptions and some recent sources assert that the devices were used either as a gag, to prevent people from speaking, or internally as an instrument of torture.

12. JUDAS CRADLE.

The victim would presumably be placed in the waist harness above the pyramid-shaped seat, with the point inserted into their an*s or v*gin*, then very slowly lowered by ropes. The subject is tortured by intense pressure and stretching of the orifice, eventually succumbing to tears in muscle tissue that could turn septic and kill from infection, or simply being impaled.

13. NECK TORTURE.

Humiliating and painful, this punishment was something of an endurance test where the victim would be hooked into a neck device, either made of metal or wood, which prevented the victim from adjusting into a comfortable position. The cruelty of this punishment lie within the fact that they were unable to lie down, eat, or lower their head for days.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274028.jpg">

14. HERETIC’S FORK.

The device was placed between the breast bone and throat just under the chin and secured with a leather strap around the neck, while the victim was hung from the ceiling or otherwise suspended in a way so that they could not lie down.Usually the Heretic’s fork was given to people who spoke the lord’s name in vain, blasphemers, or liars. This way, the punishment made it nearly impossible for them to talk. Also, a person wearing it couldn’t fall asleep. The moment their head dropped with fatigue, the prongs pierced their throat or chest, causing great pain. This very simple instrument created long periods of sleep deprivation. People were awake for days, which made confessions more likely.

15. BREAKING WHEEL/ CATHERINE WHEEL.

Was a torture device used for capital punishment from Antiquity into early modern times for public execution by breaking the criminal’s bones/bludgeoning him to death. As a form of execution, it was used from “Classical” times into the 18th century; as a form of post mortem punishment of the criminal, the wheel was still in use into 19th century Germany.

16. COFFIN TORTURE.

The most preferred torture technique in the Middle Ages was known as coffin torture. This method involved placing the victim inside a metal cage roughly the size of the human body; hence the name. The torturers also forced overweight victims into smaller cages to heighten their discomfort as they hung from a tree or gallows. Generally, they would be left there until the crows came to feed on their remains.

17. SPANISH TICKLER/ CAT’S PAW.
Is a type of torture instrument, consisting of long, sharp iron spikes curved so as to resemble claws. It was often attached to a handle, or else used as an extension of the torturer’s hand. In this way it was used to rip and tear flesh away from the bone, from any part of the body. It was also used as a weapon. This device was commonly used on thieves and unfaithful wives. Most who were tortured in this manner died not at the time, but afterwards. Especially with the Cat’s Paw, the device would cause infections as the device would cut so deep. The prongs were nearly never washed, so the chances of these infections were very high.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274032.jpg">

18. KNEE SPLITTER.

The knee splitter was a form of torture used mainly during the inquisition. It was created from two spiked wood blocks, placed in front of, and behind the knee. The blocks were connected with two large screws. When turned, the blocks would close towards each other, destroying the knee underneath them. This method was used to render the knees useless. The number of spikes on the blocks would range from three to twenty, depending on the captive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85274033.jpg">

19. HEAD CRUSHER. 
This metal device featured a plate that sat below the victim’s jaw, which was connected by a frame to the head cap. As the torturer slowly twisted the handle, the gap between the head cap and plate decreased in width, causing crushing of the skull and facial bones, including teeth and jaws, and ultimately inducing death; even if the torturer stopped before death, permanent damage to the facial muscles and structure would occur. The victim’s head would slowly be crushed, killing the victim, but not before the victim’s jaw had been crushed, and their eyes had popped from their socket.

20. IMPALEMENT.

Given his name, it should come as no surprise that this was the most favored method of execution by Vlad the Impaler. In 15th century Romania; the victim was forced to sit on a sharp and thick pole. When the pole was then raised upright, the victim was left to slide down the pole with their own weight. It could take the victim 3 days to die using this method and it has been said that Vlad once did this to 20,000 people all while enjoying a meal.

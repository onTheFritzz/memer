## <a href="#link7" id="link6">25 Things People Are Boycotting & You Should Too</a>
1. "Stubhub— the way they handled the pandemic with changing their policies in peak pandemic so people could only recover credit or resell their tickets instead of receiving cash for canceled events was ridiculous. I was forced to hold my Coachella ticket for 2 years, then they decided to refund everyone this year when they realized they would make more money since the ticket prices will surge when the event is back in 2023. Fuck stubhub." - shughes330

2. "Shaw Academy. Sleazy little fucks. Their lies in advertising, and nearly impossible to cancel a subscription with them. Tried doing a course that was "a free 4-week course". The course was free for the first 4 weeks but the way they sold it was that the course itself was 4 weeks and free. They say you can finish a course as fast or long as you want, but I think it caps out at 3 lessons a week making you stay in the program for a few months, paying monthly.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224979.jpg">

Trying to cancel is a nightmare. Sifting through pages and pages of "are you sure you want to cancel", "here's a 5% discount", "fill this form out, now this one, and now this one". All to get to a phone number that is only valid to call for a couple hours a day. When you finally get to call.. it's an automated message. 10 minutes of a robot telling me it cares about me and wants me to stay. Only to FINALLY press 2 to cancel my subscription. Fuck. Shaw Academy." - AdoptedMexican

3. "EBay. Escaped an abusive relationship, and was changing all my passwords to random combinations. Set it to log out all devices and force the password to be re-entered. It wasn't actually doing that. (I tried from multiple devices so it wasn't a keylogger or anything my abusive ex was doing. I also confirmed if I logged in on other devices, reset password and clicked to log out all devices it was not logging other devices out). Abusive ex was bidding/winning auctions. I called ebay to report the issue. They said it isn't that my account has been hacked/fraud because I know who is doing it. They would do NOTHING. Said I would just have to take the bad feedback and be blacklisted and that I should pick better partners. Didn't matter that they had a major security flaw. All I could do was remove the payment methods from my account so he couldn't pay for his auctions. I will never use them again." - TribalMog
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224981.jpg">

4. "Expedia and all the sites they own/control. Which is a LOT of them. Expedia screwed me over in a bad way, and then their Customer Service people insulted me when I tried to call attention to the serious issues. Ultimately, they offered me a gift card as a Take It or Leave It solution to the entire issue. I left it, and went on a crusade to slam them on Twitter. I did it for a long time but got bored." - Darth_Corleone

5. "Nestle. I may inadvertently grab one of it's products, but when I see the name, i always put it back." - TradePrinceGobbo
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224983.jpg">

6. "Anything that even has a hint of MLM. Stop exploiting your personal relationships out of greed." - SH00TERxx
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224984.jpg">

7. "Susan G. Koman Foundation - they employ alphabet soup & lawyer speak to defraud millions. NOTE: THEY DO NOT FUND RESEARCH NOR DO THEY HELP PATIENTS! THEY ARE AN ADVERTISING COMPANY. THEY ADVERTISE CANCER AWARENESS (because someone may be unaware of cancer \s)" - msmame

8. "Harvey Norman. They have terrible customer service and they took a whole lot of Australian government money that they didn’t deserve and are refusing to give it back." - 2exp77232917-1

9. "Comcast" - adogsgotcharacter

10. "FedEx - as much as I can help it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224988.jpg">

I obviously can't boycott them if it's the only delivery option on an e-commerce website, or if someone/company happens to ship me something via FedEx.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224989.jpg">

But I have literally chosen to pay more on an e-commerce website, to specifically not use FedEx as a shipping service.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224990.jpg">

Reason: When I bought my Pixel 3, the first day it was supposed to arrive, I worked from home that day to sign for my package. They never arrived, and on the tracking, wrote that I wasn't home to receive the package.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224991.jpg">

I was furious, so I spent the next two days working from home, and even did my work in the kitchen, so that I could physically see if any delivery driver actually walks up to my door. 3 straight fucking days in a row, not a single person comes up. Ring doorbell even doesn't show them walking up, but they have THE MOTHER FUCKING AUDACITY to claim I wasn't home 3 straight days in a row.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224992.jpg">

I ended up having to pick it up at their facility. Just because they LIED 3 times in a row, even after a phone call each day the first two days, the customer service person even told me I probably missed them when I went to the restroom or something -_- Can't even own up to the fucking fact that everybody in their company are a bunch of fucking liars.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224993.jpg">

So for that reason alone, I pay more for shipping as long as it's not FedEx. I've specifically driven a further distance to get something printed at Staples or Office Depot just so I don't step foot into a FedEx store.

Boycotting FedEx until the day I die." - needtobetterself31

11. "I was boycotting Blockbuster for charging me late fees because they lost the tape I returned in their evening return slot. Fuck those guys they ain’t getting my business!" - c0nduit
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224996.jpg">

12. "Bank of America. Fucked me over for $10 back in 1993 on a mistake they made. Never getting my motherfucking business again." - sea_cricket

14. "State Farm. Thanks to some whistleblowers, they got busted committing fraud against their customers and the federal government after Hurricane Katrina. They told their claims adjusters to classify damage as flood damage, rather than wind damage, so that they could reject the claim and tell customers to file a federal flood insurance claim." - hells_cowbells
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224999.jpg">

15. "Multi-level-marketing schemes. They’re shit companies that attract shitty, and sometimes desperate people, and train them on how to profit off of their friends and families. They destroy lives and I refuse to support them." - ClearBlue_Grace
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225000.jpg">

16. "Lifetime Fitness. It really pains me to write this, because I really love their gyms. I had a membership at Lifetime on and off through college. I went to a very large university with great amenities, so I didn’t need the membership during the school year. I tried to cancel at the end of one summer. I was at the gym one day and I asked about the cancellation. I was told to come back at a certain time frame the following Wednesday to cancel. I complied. When I showed up the “person doing the cancellations wasn’t there.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225001.jpg">

I was told to return the following Wednesday. Surprise, surprise, the person wasn’t there again. I told them I was going to stop the payment through the credit card company. They responded by telling me that they’d take me to collections then. I ended up escalating through their corporate offices to get the membership canceled. They managed to get 2 extra months of fees out of me. After that year of college, I shifted over to LA Fitness and maintained that membership for about 10 years. When I moved away from LA Fitness, I joined the YMCA, where I’ve been for the last 5-6 years. I will always have a gym membership, but I am committed to not joining Lifetime Fitness again until am reimbursed. It’s really a loss for both of us." - IGuessIamYouThen

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">Owner Shares Last Day With Her Beloved Pup</a>
1. She had this to say:
“For about two months Hannah has been having seizures, they were small and nothing to worry about, but they gradually got worse. Hannah was on a couple of meds, one for her kidneys and another for the pain she had in her elbows and her hips.
When she wasn’t on her meds, she didn’t have really bad seizures, she had them, but they weren’t horrible, but when she wasn’t on her meds, she couldn’t walk well or make it up the stairs, several times she fell down them or up them.
I finally decided that keeping her on the meds was selfish, but keeping her off of them was just as cruel. So I decided to give her one last hoo-rah day of pampering, like the queen she’s always been, and let her go. Where there would be no pain, no seizures, no whimpering in the night. Just peace and hopefully love.❤ R.I.P. Hannah.“

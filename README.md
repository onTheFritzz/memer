## <a href="#link5" id="link4">29 Shady Practices Businesses Use to Cut Costs</a>
1. The shadiest thing I’ve seen is the bartenders taking left over customers drinks off tables and mistakes and pouring them all into a pitcher all day long then serving a dollar drink in a paper cup they called “ all nations” to the drunks that hung around behind the bar like alley cats.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271548.jpg">

2. There are a number of things that less-than-scrupulous owners do to increase their margins. I’ve seen operators pour bulk liquor into premium bottles hoping guests won’t notice. Cocktail bars can print one brand on the menu and then pour another one because they ran out of the more expensive one. The shadiest thing that I’ve encountered though was an owner that tried to hire all of his staff as independent contractors so he wasn’t liable for paying payroll tax or required insurance. Treating the human capital poorly is the shadiest tactic an owner could do to cut costs.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271545.jpg">

3. There's a weird thing they do at certain restaurants where you can order pizza by the slice. When someone orders a whole pizza, they’ll take an older pizza (with some slices sold from it) that's getting close to its hold time, fill the missing slices in from the new pizza, and serve the Frankenstein pizza to the customer. Then they have a bunch of brand new slices to sell instead of having to throw out the expired slices.

4. It was back in the 1970's. I was a young cook in a restaurant in LaCrosse Wisconsin. Most restaurants would run a Friday night all you can eat special which was always fried fish, usually beer battered, Cole slaw and fries. Yep, YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.. An extra dishwasher was scheduled that night to search the returning plates for untouched fish and fries. These would be refried and served again. The owner's explanation was that the refrying killed all “GERMS". Needless to say I rapidly found another job before someone got sick and the kitchen was blamed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271549.jpg">

5. In my teen years I worked at a Sonic Drive In. When it got slow, the manager would make us carhops dig through the trash (no gloves) and pull out unused ketchup, mustard, etc packets and put them back in the bin on the shelf. I did that once and then quit and never went back!

My cousin work at the same Sonic and she said they used to make her wipe the green slime off of the hot dog wieners and then throw them on the grill. Barf!!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271550.jpg">

6. I was a 16-year-old waitress in a deli and my cheap boss would make me re-use the soda cups unless they had obvious lipstick marks on them. I lost all respect for him and soon quit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271551.jpg">

7. Many years ago I tended bar for a guy that was the ultimate of cheap. He would go to restaurants and pick up the raw chicken they were throwing away, take it in the bar’s kitchen and bleach it in strong Clorox solution until it was Snow White, cover it in really hot sauce, salt it like crazy and cook it up for h’orderves. Everyone ate it. I don’t know how many people got sick from it but they kept coming back for more.

8. Back in the late 70’s I had a close friend who worked at a swanky restaurant in Calabasas, CA. One of the jobs she had was to remove the unused “garnish” from plates returning to the kitchen, to be used on new plates going out to customers. I was incredulous and had to see for myself, so I stopped by one night. Sure enough, she was the first person in “scrape” (kitchen slang for the area where used plates were brought to be scraped of major food debris before loading into the dishwasher), and would take parsley off and put it in a pile to the side, then scrape off the little pile of peas and carrots into a bin. Eventually, someone would come by and grab the parsley, peas & carrots, and take them to where new dishes were being assembled and the garnish would be used again. Gross!!! Who know what happens to that food while it’s out there, or how many times it was re-used? Now, when I eat at a restaurant that has garnish on the plate, I carefully shove it to the side so it won’t touch the rest of my food.

9. Let's hop in the Tardis, and travel back to Korea, circa 1982.

I was in the Army, Military Police, and, of course, every Camp had a few bars, which were set up for servicemen. When I was at Camp Long, there was one such club which I frequented. The beer and wine they served there was absolutely awful. After a few weeks, I learned one of the reasons it was so awful.

Since I treated the ladies there with basic human dignity, (which was rare, in these types of bars), they let me play at being a DJ, some nights. The DJ booth was behind the bar, and folks wanting a particular song played would send me a bottle of beer, with a note. For a young Army private, it was a cheap way to get drunk.

So, where does the shady cost savings enter the picture?

I wasn't exactly observant, back then, but eventually I noticed there were usually a few open beer bottles, behind the bar. This finally sunk in, stirring my curiosity, so I kept one eye out. One of the ladies had just cleared a table, and one of the beer bottles was not empty. She poured the remains into one of the bottles behind the bar, capped it with a manual capping thingy, and put it in the cooler, to sell to someone else.

10. I used to work at Wendy's and the "unsalted fries" were just old fries thrown back in the fryer for 30 seconds to "get the salt off"

11. I have never worked in a restaurant but I cook a lot and find it interesting to take a scientific approach to cooking. I therefore know that one common method of tenderizing sliced meat is to add baking soda. The baking soda breaks down protein and leaves the meat very tender, with a slightly spongy texture. It only works on the muscle tissue however, and still leaves any stringy connective tissue just as tough and stringy as before. It also adds a slight alkaline flavor, which can usually be covered up with a marinade or seasoning. Having figured this out, I can instantly spot when restaurants use this trick. The biggest giveaway is the presence of tough connective tissue within otherwise very tender meat. And it bothers me quite a bit when an establishment advertises a dish to contain “flank steak” or “rib eye” when it’s just a cheap cut tenderized with baking soda. There’s nothing wrong with using baking soda for this purpose (actually aids digestion), but I still like truth in advertising! This trick is used mainly in Chinese stir-fry, and is quite prevalent, from what I’ve experienced.

12. This is mostly not an answer… but I’m sharing it anyway.

A lifetime ago I was working in a bar, and doing stand-up comedy on the side.

One line I used to use was that the owner of the bar I worked in was so cheap that each new year, as the clock struck midnight he would go round each of the whiskey bottles with a sharpie. Changing the “15 year old scotch” to “16 year old scotch” and putting the price up.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271556.jpg">

13. I went with friends to a local chain Mexican restaurant in Northern Virginia for dessert.

As it was close to closing time the staff were cleaning up for the night. They were emptying the bowls of tortillas and the salsa from the tables back in the packets/jars. My friends questioned the staff about the hygiene and the manager denied they were doing anything wrong. Needless to say we left and my friends have never been back
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271557.jpg">

14. There are two extremely shady things that I’ve seen restaurants do to save money that top my list.

Years ago, I was working banquets as a part time gig for a hotel to help them get through a busy few weeks. One night, we served a large wedding, and at the end, about 30% of the food was left over. Instead of offering it to staff and throwing the rest of it away, it was saved for later use. I know a lot more about food safety now than I did back then, but even back then I knew that this was wrong. Trays of food that had been sitting out for hours, and not held hot, need to be thrown away.

The most shady thing I’ve witnessed occurred long ago. I worked in a bar and restaurant, and perhaps their most important employee was their do-it-all dishwasher. I will call him Albert. Albert was an extremely diligent man of about 50, and he also happened to be mentally challenged. The owners took advantage of his hard work and unfortunately, also took advantage of the fact that had a low IQ. They made him do every job that no one wanted to do, and quite frankly, the place would have come to a screeching halt if he decided to not show up for work one day. He worked 80 hours a week at minimum wage and did not get paid overtime. They paid him in cash for his overtime hours, but that still works out to considerably less in that particular tax jurisdiction. When the minimum wage would go up, they would tell him he is getting a raise. This is easily the most blatant abuse of a worker that I have ever seen. He was the kindest, hardest working man I’ve known in the industry. At least the rest of the staff treated him with respect and kindness.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271547.jpg">

15. Besides watering down booze or lying about premium labels, I think the worst atrocity is claiming local,organic, farm to table yada yada & getting all your products off a Syso truck.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271558.jpg">

16. Do I have a story for you. When I was in college I took a part time serving job at a restaurant near my parents. The guy who ran it was CHEAP. He would serve food that was past it’s due date regularly including dairy desserts, if it had visible mold he would throw it out, but only when it was visibly moldy!

This man would make me go through the lettuce for the salad bar by hand and pick out the wilted pieces instead of just using fresh lettuce, not only cheap, but super unsanitary. He would make me do the same thing with fruit, but if the fruit was moldy he would just store it in the walk in freezer to cut the bad parts off and use.

He couldn’t afford cleaners so he expected his servers to come in an hour before their shifts, clean the bathrooms and then PREP THE FOOD. Sometimes he would even make me clean the front porches by hand with a wash cloth and bleach (it was an Inn/Restaurant) prior to opening.

He even kept his compost in the walk in fridge, which in hindsight is the weirdest thing he did, who does that???

I won’t say where the place is though, he had to close and the place was bought by a new owner who has done an absolutely wonderful job!!!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271559.jpg">

17. Way back in the late 70’s my high school girlfriend worked at a movie theater in Studio City, CA. Each night at closing they would bag any leftover popcorn and put the hot dogs back into the fridge. The next day they would dump the popcorn back into the ‘Fresh Hot Popcorn!” machine and put the hot dogs back into that greasy display case.

The hot dog thing was gross enough, but recycling a few cents worth of popcorn is definitely the chintziest thing I’ve seen.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271560.jpg">

18. I’ve never answered a question before, but I do have a shocking cost-saving story to share.

I worked in a handful of restaurants in my teens and twenties, and they’ve all done some stuff you wouldn’t want to hear about as a patron, but one place really takes the cake. It was a “fine dining” spot in Niagara Falls, Canada.

We once served either lobster or crab for dinner service, I can’t remember which. When we brought the dirty dishes back to the kitchen, the chef had us save the shells to make stock for soup the next day. Shells that had been on everyone’s plates - in their mouths. Eugh.

At the time I was young and was disgusted, but assumed this was some sort of common practice within restaurants. I now realize the chef was just cheap. Oh and morally repugnant.

Thinking back on it grosses me out entirely.

edit: doing a little digging into my profile I see I have answered two questions before! Baby brain. I’d totally forgotten.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271561.jpg">

19. A local popular chinese restaurant advertise all you can eat sushi. People start with plates of food, eat 1/4–1/2 and then when the bill arrives they find out the restaurant is charging them for the uneaten food in an effort to minimize waste. So they quickly see their patronage decline to the point they changed the way the all-you-can-eat sushi was being given. A waiter would be assigned to a group of tables and you had to order what food you wanted, and they would get it for you, no more serve-yourself. Again, people would order food, not like it, and then waste it. So they’d get pissed-off again for being charged for the wasted food. And so their patronage dropped yet again. Finally, they stopped offering all-you-can-eat and went back to a traditional restaurant type of service, and stopped trying to charge customers for wasting food.

Eventually, they finally closed their doors to business. People stopped going and had had enough. Too bad really as their bento-box ordered food was great and they also made an amazing curried pork.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271562.jpg">

20. Watered down liquor.

Bread or food that appeared to be salvaged from another diner or diners who didn’t eat it or touch it.

I never worked in a restaurant or bar but these were observations of things someone told me sometime or that I might have read even that rather freaked me out. Not the end of the world but not appetizing.

Good time enders.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271563.jpg">

21. One of the biggest shadiest thing is washing meats that doesn’t smell good at all with vinegar and lemon juice and cooking it like nothing happen discussing. A lot of them use expire pasta or can product and the worse of them are the ones that use the food that the health department says is bad and hazardous Nd they even take it out of thrash and still use it. If we only knew what happens in the back of the house .
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271564.jpg">

22. My first bartending gig was in a very popular night club ran by a family not necessarily known for being the most legit business folks in town. They only had a small handful of employees on the books and most of us were paid under the table at the end of each shift.

The business always changed hands and names whenever they were sued by former employees or got hit with huge fines. We'd show up for work and often the doors were locked with “Out of Business” signs and then called back in a few weeks later to work but the name of the place was different and no one had any idea who the actual owner was anymore.

One particularly busy night, I happened to see a manager filling up Patrón bottles with a bottom shelf tequila. He was a close enough friend that I felt comfortable asking wtf. He admitted most of our high-end liquors were actually just sh*t booze poured into better brand bottles. I was not only shocked by the deception (and knowing what we charged for “Patrón” considering!) but also that I'd never had a single customer mention any kind of doubt when ordering Patrón or Grey Goose or whatever. In fact, we often had a large percentage of Mexican customers who scoffed when ordering tequila shots and were asked “well or do you have a preference?” They'd reply things like “I only drink Patrón, none of that other sh*t!” And while I was mortified to be part of this huge scam going on behind the bar, I was more intrigued by not a single person noticing the $12 shots they were ordering in quick succession were actually just “that other sh*t”.

I've since worked for other owners guilty of this same cost-saving tactic and suspect it's a more common practice than we realize. I've also seen more expensive bottles of liquor get watered down. I almost always stick with well drinks these days when I'm out on the town and when I'm the one pouring on the other side, charge well prices for any bottles I've opened and think the cap came loose a little too easy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271565.jpg">

23. For me, it’s some of the more rural areas of Belarus. I kid you not, in most street vendor places if you order a cup of coffee you get charged for the cup, the stir stick, the sugar (rather you asked for it or not) and the coffee. It’s quite comical really. The wife gets mad at me when I mess with the sellers and say, no I don’t need the cup thanks. The confused look on their face is priceless. Several times, to the missus embarrassment, I have actually had the waitress/waiter remove the charge for the sugar. The majority of the restaurants cut their napkins in half. The food is relatively cheap (at least for me, not as much for the locals) but the portions are small. I usually order two on some of the dishes I know won’t fill me up. I love Belarus, but man are some of the restaurants skimpy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271566.jpg">

24. When I was in high school I worked as a “busboy” in a high end restaurant. If people knew what went on in the kitchen they would have been appalled. All I can say is I’m glad the place is long gone.

When diners came in, we were to take rolls from a large bin and place them in a toaster then deliver them to the table. That’s all well and good. But if any rolls came back uneaten, they were to go back in the bin. Yup. Gross, shady cost-saving tactic for you.

But, the owners also had two BIG dobermans they kept in the kitchen. If we brought back any plates that had meat or bones, we were to give them to the dogs. How would you like knowing that where your food was being prepared, two dogs were running around, slobering over someone’s leftovers?

Each night after we closed, the owners, a husband and wife, would sit down to a lobster or steak that had been made in that very kitchen. Apparently, they must’ve saved a lot by recycling those rolls!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271567.jpg">

25. I’ve seen the workers at the chinese buffet dump the old left over food in with the fresh and stir it up good.

I just thought waste not want not.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271569.jpg">

26. Depends on location but watch out for the liquid cheese. Some managers will make the crew pour boiling water from the coffee maker into it when it's almost out to "make more"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271570.jpg">

27. My family and I have owned a local Italian restaurant for 30 years. I’ve had employees from most of the restaurants in town over the years and I try every new restaurant. Common shady things I’ve heard/seen are using pork instead of veal at other local restaurants (when veal is on the menu as $1 more than chicken something is wrong as it’s 6x more expensive), pouring house wine as premium wine, refilling premium liquor with well (I don't have a bar/liquor, just beer and wine), the same cheaper beer on tap for multiple selections, using off brand coca-cola products as the real stuff on coke machines (you have to buy a special adapter), using cheese with modified food starch (potato) for pizza/dinners (all the pizza chains use this), using expired products, using butter blend or margarine instead of real butter which is 3x more expensive…
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271571.jpg">

28. When I was in high school in the early 70’s, I worked as a car hop at a famous root beer brand franchise in Sikeston, Mo., which served its root beer and other drinks in heavy frosted mugs. The owner was astoundingly cheap, as was his son, who was a partner in the business.

When the mugs came back in, they were cleaned in a 3-bay sink by 1. Pouring out the drink and ice remnants in the first sink and upending the mug, twisting it over a bristled scrubber that was suctioned-cupped to the sink bottom. Then 2. doused in the next sink compartment, that had detergent mixed in, then 3. Doused in the next compartment, which was a rinse sink. Then placed in a rack to dry and get re-frosted. Per mug: about 3–4 seconds total.

That was fine, efficient and I’m sure sanitary. What wasn’t was that this owner made us dunk the returned plastic straws in the detergent and rinse and re-use them. This place is no longer in business and hasn’t been for many years. I haven’t lived in Missouri since 1972 but from what I understand, the owner and his wife eventually passed away and the word was that the son and his wife took a Class A motorhome out on a test drive and never came back. I don’t know if that rumor is true, so Jerry, my apologies if it isn’t…
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87271572.jpg">

29. There seems to be particular liquors that somewhat emulate the taste of more expensive brands that some places refill bottles with. Sauza Silver is pretty similar to Patron, Cutty Sark is pretty similar to Jameson, and over rocks it’s pretty hard to tell the difference. At least not so much that someone would start an argument with a server as it’s also kind of impossible to prove.

Of course there’s a lot of this at restaurants as well especially with intentionally mislabeled fish. Also, anyone selling Kobi beef anything or Truffle anything is likely to have zero percent of those actual ingredients unless it’s served as the whole ingredient and you pay a truly significant price.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">10 Things Hidden In Plain Sight On The Covers of Famous Albums</a>
1. 1. THE ROLLING STONES // THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST

When The Rolling Stones released Their Satanic Majesties Request in 1967, it immediately drew comparisons to The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was released earlier in the same year. Both records feature psychedelic music and very colorful album art, but Their Satanic Majesties Request actually features images of all four of the Beatles hidden in the foreground. It is believed that this was a response to The Beatles' album, which featured a Shirley Temple doll wearing a sweater that reads, "Welcome The Rolling Stones Good Guys."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1035099/85039401.png">

2. 2. THE BEASTIE BOYS // LICENSED TO ILL

The Beastie Boys' debut album, Licensed to Ill, features a jet plane with the serial number "3MTA3" on its tail. If you look at the album cover in a mirror, the reverse image now reads, "EATME," or "Eat Me."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1035099/85039402.png">

3. 3. KATE BUSH // AERIAL

The cover of Aerial, Kate Bush's eighth studio album, appears to feature a mountain range with its reflection in the sea. However, if you look closely, it's actually a waveform of a blackbird's song on top of a photograph of a sunrise. The waveform is a reference to the final track on Aerial's second disc (about 37:28 into disc two or 3:18 into track nine), which features a blackbird's chirping.

4. 4. DEF LEPPARD // RETRO ACTIVE

Def Leppard's Retro Active features a 19th century woman sitting at a dressing table staring at a mirror. If you look at the cover at a distance, you can see a skull made up of the woman and her reflection. Artist Charles Allan Gilbert's 1892 painting All is Vanity was Def Leppard's inspiration for the album cover.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1035099/85039404.png">

5. 5. SANTANA // SANTANA

At first glance, Santana's debut record looks like it only features a ferocious lion. However, if you take a closer look, you can see that it also features nine smaller faces that make up the lion's head. Additionally, the lion's chin can also be seen as a hula skirt, only to reveal a hula girl at the album cover's center.

According to the album cover designer, Lee Conklin, "I knew that I was making art for future generations and so even though Bill [Graham, band manager] usually liked posters in colour, I detailed this one in pen-and-ink…the challenge has always been to subvert the poster form to whatever my muse insists on and then to convert my psychedelic experiences to any medium I’m working in. I made it my mission to translate my psychedelic experience into paper."

6. 6. SUPERTRAMP // BREAKFAST IN AMERICA

The album cover for Supertramp's Breakfast in America features a waitress named Libby posing as the Statue of Liberty with a menu and a glass of orange juice on a tray. In the background, what at first glance appears to be the Manhattan skyline is actually cereal boxes, salt and pepper shakes, cutlery, mugs, and various kitchen items made up to look like New York City. Supertramp won a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for Breakfast in America in 1980.

7. 7. BLACK LIPS // 200 MILLION THOUSAND

Aside from the band's name and the title of the record, 200 Million Thousand from Black Lips seemingly only features black and white lines on its album cover. However, if you stare at the cover long enough, you'll start to make up the faint outlines of a man's face wearing a gold teeth grill. On the back of the album, you can see the same image, but without the optical illusion.

8. 8. HARRY NILSSON & JOHN LENNON // PUSSY CATS

Recording artist Harry Nilsson teamed up with John Lennon to produce Pussy Cats in 1974. The album cover features a rug under a table with two block letters—"D" and "S"—flanking it.  If you sound out the puzzle, it reads, "D-rug-S" or specifically, "Drugs under the table." This was an inside joke during Lennon's "Lost Weekend" era, a drunken and drug-fueled 18 month period between 1973 and 1975.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1035099/85039408.png">

9. 9. THE VELVET UNDERGROUND // WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT

In 1968, The Velvet Underground released White Light/White Heat with a seemingly all-black album cover. If you take a closer look, though, you can see a faint image of a skull tattoo on Andy Warhol collaborator Joe Spencer's arm.

"After the first album came out, Lou (Reed) said he would like me to be responsible for the album art for the second album,” explained Billy Name, photographer and former manager of Andy Warhol's Factory. “I said 'why don’t you look through my negatives, see if you find something you like,' and he found this one and pointed to it. It turned out it was a tattoo on Joe Spencer’s arm, his bicep. So I had to blow it up from a 35 millimeter negative, so it came out pretty grainy. So we decided to do a black on black.”

The darkened image is really hard to spot unless you know what you're looking for or you place the album cover under a black light. Re-issues featured a more pronounced tattoo image.

10. 10. THE BEATLES // REVOLVER

German artist Klaus Voormann created the artwork for The Beatles' Revolver. While the album cover features many different versions of The Beatles drawn in pencil and in various photographs, Voormann placed an image of himself and his name inside of George Harrison's hair, which is located on the right-side of the album cover.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">20 Celebrities Who Destroyed Their Own Careers</a>
1. Antonio Brown. Drove 100 down McKnight Road in Pittsburgh, which has a 45 MPH speed limit. Tried to fight Mike Mayock, called him a cracker, had to be held back by Vontaze Burfict, then punted a football down the practice field and said "fine me for that." The sexual assault allegations came out. Etc, etc... -reverend_fancypants
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020139/87289829/ab.jpg">

2. Bam Margera for me. He looks horrible now, like his dad but worse. Wouldn't be surprised if I wake up one morning and he's dead. -True_Egg_5685
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020142/87289830/bam.jpg">

3. John Belushi. In a brief period in the 1970s starred in 'SNL', 'Animal House',  and 'The Blues Brothers'. but died in 1982 from a heroin overdose. -c-fox
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020149/87289831/belushi.png">

4. Brad Renfro. He died of a drug overdose at the age of 25 after a steep downward spiral. It is suspected he was the victim of Hollywood predator types when he was still a young boy, right after starring in "The Client" as his star was rapidly ascending. -igneousink
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020150/87289832/bradrenfro.jpg">

5. I know it’s a bit of a niche but… Conor McGregor. The Khabib fight was the biggest in his career. Two years of layoff, returning to face an unstoppable juggernaut. The press conferences were packed with vitriol and pure bile rather than the typical tongue in cheek charm. It was uncharacteristic - or rather, it was the mask coming off at last.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020153/87289834/conor.jpg">

He got humiliated badly, and everything went wild. Cocaine. Sexual assault scandals, whether true or not. Alcohol. He started his own whiskey brand. Apparently it’s garbage, but don’t take it from me. Take it from the old man he sucker punched in a bar for refusing to drink it. -DrJonesPHD62
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020157/87289835/cosby.jpg">

6. Bill Cosby. He was America's favorite Dad, stand up comic, had several very successful TV shows, spoke at colleges....then poof! He's just a dirty creepy guy who spikes your drink so he can get some. -Eponarose
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020135/87289828/amandabynes.jpg">

7. Amanda Bynes. Went from the girl next door cast in every teen movie to a conservatorship and addiction issues. -Kmammy
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020158/87289836/jim.jpg">

8. Jim Morrison. The guy would show up drunk and absolutely wrecked all the time during recordings, got arrested on many occasions for his behavior, and later on dies literally right after coming from a bar in his own bathtub. It’s sad and I absolutely adore him as an artist but man is it sad to hear what he got himself into leading to his inevitable death. -TheBeanBagger
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020159/87289837/johnny.jpg">

9. Johnny Manziel. He beeat Alabama, won the Heisman trophy, was on top of the college football world. Still got drafted in the first round despite trouble starting to mount in his final year at Texas A&M.

Struggled immensely on and off the field in Cleveland (domestic violence, disappearing to Vegas wearing a disguise, and much more), was out of the NFL after two seasons, and was dropped by nearly everyone in his circle. Popped back up in the CFL, then to the Alliance League, and now he’s a former Heisman Trophy winner/1st round NFL Draft pick playing in the Fan-Controlled Football League. -MIDNIGHT_KNIGHT

10. Amy Winehouse. Watching her destruction throughout 2007 and 2008 was just horrible, it was like a car crash that no one could stop. I’ve never been able to watch the footage of her final concert in Belgrade as she just looks terrified and with no control. -Btd030914

11. Jussie Smollett. I think his prime motivation was that fame wasn’t enough for him. He wanted to become a symbol, too. And what’s a more positive symbol than standing against racism?  -PenguinGunner

12. Lance Armstrong had an incredible fall from grace. From multiple Tour de France champion to steroid denier, and finally admitted everything but too late. Lost everything and he couldn't even get sympathy when he went through testicular cancer, that's how bad his spiral was. -jspockman
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020217/87289842/kurt.jpg">

13. Michael Richards comes to mind. Massive role as Kramer in one of the most popular TV sitcoms of all time, and then, yikes. Just no coming back from his stand-up meltdown. -Trillamanjaroh
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020221/87289843/mel.jpg">

14. Kurt Cobain. Formed Nirvana in '87, and went from playing record store gigs and dive bars in the late 80's to putting out Nevermind, a record that knocked Michael Jackson out of the #1 spot in Jan of '92. Back then, something like that was unheard of and considered impossible in the industry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020151/87289833/chris.jpg">

For the next couple of years Nirvana were arguably one of the biggest and most popular rock bands in the world, but Cobain was already thinking of ways to essentially sabotage the bands popularity because he was so uncomfortable with how famous they got while dealing with his own inner demons and drug addiction. -DrRDuke

15. Maybe not most destructive, but Mel Gibson fell hard.

Guy went from being quite a beloved and pretty decent actor to a respected director, and then said some really hateful things about Jews in the back of a police car (among other things). -Jonnydodger

16. I think of Chris Farley. His SNL career started in '92(ish), his real break came with 'Tommy Boy' in '94. Dead by '98 at 33 years old. Horribly addicted to drugs, alcohol, food, and other impulse related stuff probably. Probably gained 100lbs in his 6 year run.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Which Hottie Is The World’s Sexiest One-Armed Girl?</a>
1. This is Lauren, a 21-year-old from San Diego, who took the internet by storm recently with her sexy and hilarious Tinder profile. Jokingly claiming she is an “arms dealer,” she called out the fact that she is only 1 for 2 on the arm front, but pointed out that her face is a 10 out of 10, her body is 9 out of 10 and her personality is a 20 out of 10, which is clear.

2. And here is KJ. She also seems to have a sense of humor about her missing arm, boasting that there will be no awkward arm when cuddling with her... I would have to say either girl is a WIN!

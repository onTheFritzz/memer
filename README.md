1. This conversation must have gone something like this: "Sorry, sir, but spearguns are not allowed on the plane..." OBVIOUSLY.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85108057.jpg">

16. Think the attempted gun smugglers are bad? They're nothing compared to the attempted grenade smugglers.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Bank Mishap Gives Man Unlimited Funds And Unlimited Trouble</a>
1. Luke Moore opened up an account with the Australian bank St George in 2010, when he was  22. Unemployed and claiming benefits, he ran up overdrafts of $9,000 after a year.  Realizing that he basically had a  limitless overdraft he continued to withdraw and spend money.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85222723.jpg">

2. He started buying cars, boats and even signed albums by Bob Dylan and Michael Jackson. Among his purchases were lavish vacations, a £32,000 ($36K) Stessl boat, a £54,000($56K) Aston Martin and a £100,000 ($104K) Maserati.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85222724.jpg">

3. The Police were called after the Bank realized Moore owed them £1.25m ($1.4M)  They also discovered that roughly  £650,000 ($680K) of the money had been stashed in secondary bank accounts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85222725.jpg">

4. Moore was originally sentenced for obtaining financial advantage by deception and dealing proceeds of a crime.  Moore is now free and, as he told Australia's Daily Telegraph, "re-adjusting to real life,” living with his mother in Goulburn, New South Wales, and studying to become a criminal lawyer. In his appeal judgment last month Justice Mark Leeming noted that Moore had acted "extremely foolishly" - but had not deceived the bank.

5. Here are some of the things he bought:  The Aston Martin.

9. An autographed Michael Jordan jersey.  Although he says he wouldn't do it again, Moore told he misses "cocaine, strippers and fast cars," adding: "I had to give everything back and I now drive a shoebox Falcon but I'm happier this way as I've realized my family and friends are my biggest treasures."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85222731.jpg">

10. The total Luke spend is said to be $2,189,000.  He somehow avoided jail, but still has to pay back the money.   Good luck with that!

10. Eduard Bloch, the Jewish physician of the Hitler family in his office c. 1938. Bloch was later called a ‘noble Jew’ by Hitler and stood under his personal protection.

This was his family physician growing up. Hitler had siblings, and parents. This doctor did all he could while they were poor, and when Hitler’s mother had cancer. He kindly gave them discounts on medicine, and apparently didn’t charge them when they really needed it. He was supposedly quite fond of the family in general, and when the Holocaust and Nazi rise occurred, Dr Bloch and his wife were protected, and admitted to leave the country without harassment, even allowed to sell their home at a normal price. Dr Bloch really tried to help Hitler’s mother during her illness, and Hitler really appreciated it, even sent the guy flowers at Christmas.
When Dr Bloch wrote to Hitler during the Anschluss, Hitler immediately responded by sending the Gestapo to make sure no harm came to the Blochs.

14. Two women collect the remains of a dead horse for food, Siege of Leningrad, 1941.

The 872-day Siege of Leningrad, Russia, resulted from the failure of the German Army Group North to capture Leningrad in the Eastern Front of World War II. The siege lasted from September 8, 1941 to January 27, 1944 and was one of the longest and most destructive sieges in history, causing considerable devastation to the city of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The total number of human losses during the 29 months of the siege of Leningrad is estimated as 1.5 million, both civilian and military. Only 700,000 people were left alive of a 3.5 million pre-war population. Among them were soldiers, workers, surviving children and women. Of the 700,000 survivors, about 300,000 were soldiers who came from other parts of the country to help in the besieged city.

15. Saigon execution: Murder of a Vietcong by Saigon Police Chief, 1968.

After Nguyen Ngoc Loan raised his sidearm and shot Vietcong operative Nguyen Van Lem in the head he walked over to the reporters and told them that: “These guys kill a lot of our people, and I think Buddha will forgive me”. Captured on NBC TV cameras and by AP photographer Eddie Adams, the picture and film footage flashed around the world and quickly became a symbol of the Vietnam War’s brutality. Eddie Adams’ picture was especially striking, as the moment frozen is one almost at the instant of death. 
For all the image’s political impact, though, the situation wasn’t as black-and-white as it’s rendered. What Adams’ photograph doesn’t reveal is that the man being shot (named Nguyen Van Lem) was the captain of a Vietcong “revenge squad” that had executed dozens of unarmed civilians earlier the same day.

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">13 Fascinating Facts To Feed Your Brain </a>
1. A Russian MIG Pilot defected during the cold war along with his aircraft. When he arrived in the USA he was convinced the CIA had specially stocked the grocery stores he went to because he couldn’t believe the vast array of products for sale.

Q: Like what did you do, for example?
Belenko: First of all American super-market, my first visit was under CIA supervision, and I thought it was set-up; I did not believe super-market was real one. I thought well I was unusual guest; they probably kicked everyone out. It’s such a nice, big place with incredible amount of produce, and no long lines! You’re accustomed to long lines in Russia. But later, when I discovered super-market was real one, I had real fun exploring new products. I would buy, everyday, a new thing and try to figure out its function. In Russia at that time (and even today) it’s hard to find canned food, good one. But everyday I would buy new cans with different food. Once I bought a can which said “dinner.” I cooked it with potatoes, onions, and garlic-it was delicious. Next morning my friends ask me, “Viktor, did you buy a cat?” It was a can of chicken-based cat food. But it was delicious! It was better than canned food for people in Russia today. And I did test it. Last year I brought four people from Russia for commercial project, and I set them up. I bought nibble sized human food. I installed a pâté, and it was cat food. I put it on crackers. And they did consume it, and they liked it. So the taste has not changed. By the way, for those who are not familiar with American cat food. It’s very safe; it’s delicious, and sometimes it’s better than human food, because of the Humane Society.

2. The Nazis developed an experimental drug cocktail called D-IX in which the Nazi doctors found that equipment-laden test subjects who had taken the drug could march 55 miles without resting.

Pharmacologist Gerhard Orzechowski and a group of other researchers were commissioned in Kiel to develop this drug, and by later in the year developed a formula which contained in each tablet: 5 mg of oxycodone (brand name Eukodal), 5 mg of cocaine and 3 mg of methamphetamine (then called Pervitin, now available under the brand name Desoxyn).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310219.jpg">

3. The Canadian government established one of the most northern settlements in the world by tricking 8 families into living there and then not allowing them to leave.

“The settlement (and Resolute) was created by the Canadian government in 1953, partly to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War. Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife. They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada’s claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were forced to stay.”

4. Even though he was a teenager during the Great Depression, John F. Kennedy confessed he really didn’t know about it until he read about it at Harvard. 

Joe Kennedy never publicly revealed his wealth, but the New York Times estimated his net worth at $500,000,000 when he died in 1969
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310221.jpg">

5. A Man Stopped Growing At Six Months Old Is Now 21 And Only 23 Inches Tall
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310222.png">

6. During the Vietnam War Hugh Thompson Jr. order his men to turn their guns on American soldiers to protect Vietnamese civilians and helped put a stop to the My Lai Massacre (mass killing of between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians in South Vietnam)

Realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese, Thompson landed his aircraft between them and the villagers. Thompson turned to Colburn and Andreotta and told them that if the Americans began shooting at the villagers or him, they should fire their M60 machine guns at the Americans: “Y’all cover me! If these bastards open up on me or these people, you open up on them. Promise me!”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310223.jpg">

7. During WW2 Joe Medicine Crow, a native American, completed all four feats required to be a war chief: touching an enemy without killing him, taking an enemy’s weapon, leading a war party and stealing 50 horses from the SS, singing a Crow honour song as he rode away

He touched a living enemy soldier and disarmed him after turning a corner and finding himself face to face with a young German soldier:
The collision knocked the German’s weapon to the ground. Mr. Crow lowered his own weapon and the two fought hand-to-hand. In the end Mr. Crow got the best of the German, grabbing him by the neck and choking him. He was going to kill the German soldier on the spot when the man screamed out ‘momma.’ Mr. Crow then let him go.

8. A man once tried to sue Pepsi because he found a mouse in his can of Mountain Dew, Pepsi defended the case by proving that Mountain Dew can dissolve a mouse in a few months
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310225.png">

9. Stephen King’s formula on writing is “Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can’t expect to become a good writer.” He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310226.jpg">

10. Pepsi is being sued because of its Naked Juice marketing. While the juice is marketed as “healthy”, it actually has a higher sugar content than an equivalent amount of Pepsi Cola.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310227.jpg">

11. Coke was sued for the “unwarranted health claims” on their product Vitaminwater. Coke’s defense was “no consumer could reasonably be misled into thinking vitamin water was a healthy beverage.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85310228.jpg">

12. Serial killer Javed Iqbal was sentenced to death by being strangled in front of his victims family’s, dismembered and then burned in a vat of acid, in the same way he killed over 100 16 year old boys. He was found dead in his cell before the execution could be carried out.

He was only caught because he sent a confession letter to the police in which he gave his address and left the remains of 2 victims in his house.
A placard in his home read: “All details of the murders are contained in the diary and the 32-page notebook that have been placed in the room and had also been sent to the authorities. This is my confessional statement.” Another placard read: “The bodies in the house have deliberately not been disposed of so that the authorities will find them after my suicide.”

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">A Mysterious Box In Grandfather’s Attic Unlocked A 200-Year-Old Secret</a>
1. A few weeks ago, the Lopez family decide to clean their grandfather's attic.

They expected to find some memories of the past, but they couldn't have bargained for what they stumbled upon.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080865.jpg">

2. But to understand this story, you need a bit of context.

When they were children, the grandfather would tell them stories about his father, Ernesto Lopez. According to him, Ernesto had found the pirate Jose Gaspar's treasure in the Hillsborough River.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080866.jpg">

3. They'd always dismissed it as legend -- until they found a box in the attic.

Jose Gaspar was a notorious (and very real) Spanish pirate. Though they knew he was an actual person, they could have never assumed their great-grandfather got ahold of his treasure -- but then recently, they found the box.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080867.jpg">

4. So what was inside?

For starters, they found a crude map of Tampa, likely drawn years ago.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080868.jpg">

5. Here's a drawing of Jose Gaspar, taken from a 1900 brochure.

But the unearthed treasures were about to get even better.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080869.jpg">

6. Yup: They found old Portuguese and Spanish coins, likely from the 1700s.

Visits to numerous antique stores in the area revealed that these coins are the real deal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080870.jpg">

7. Finding real, centuries-old treasure is exciting in and of itself.

But what's that at the top of the box? Could it be what it actually looks like?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080871.jpg">

8. That's right, it's a preserved human hand wearing a ring.

Why their great-grandfather would keep that, they may never know.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080872.jpg">

9. The Lopez family is still trying to make sense of it all.

"Either my great-grandfather made the best, most elaborate pirate hoax ever and never shared it with anyone or he really did find some treasure on the Hillsborough River. There's really no way to know which is the case," Maria Lopez said in an interview.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85080873.jpg">

10. No matter the truth, it's a pretty amazing thing to find in an attic.

It also reminds us all that you never know what might be hiding in storage -- so don't just assume it's all dusty Christmas decorations. You could be sitting on a literal treasure!

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">16 Fascinating and Rare Photos of Celebrities</a>
1. Lilian Bond posing for a publicity picture in the early 1930s. One of Hollywood's first sex symbols, she did numerous photo shoots that for the time were considered more risqué than pin up model shoots and other shoots, even posing nude in beautifully done artistic shots very evident of the era. She did films for nearly 30 years, retiring in 1958.

2. Dave Navarro with his date for the night, porn actress Jayme Langford, at an event in 2016. The internet blew up with the story she was actually his daughter, but this is false. In fact, she was just another girl on the list of pornstars he has been with including Sasha Grey, Jenna Haze, Stormy Daniels, Tila Tequila, Jenna Jameson, Brittany Skye and numerous others.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85355526.jpg">

3. No, that's not Marilyn Monroe, but one of her clones Jeanne Carmen in a photo shoot in the late 1950s. Carmen was not much of an actress but did plenty of modeling. What I find interesting here is she is part of a huge group of women who literally modeled themselves after Marilyn Monroe. Monroe was so huge, tons of other girls wanted to be her, and some literally tried. There have been incidents of people posing as Marilyn at events all throughout the 1950s and early 60s, even after the icons death in 1962. Jeanne Carmen is a prime example of at least an established clone, as some of her modelling shoots are incredibly similar to Monroe's. Even today we still occasionally see actresses and models trying to channel Monroe's iconic style and look.

4. Jonah Hill attends an event with his girlfriend Ali Hoffman in 2012. Hoffman is Dustin Hoffman's daughter.

5. Tony Randall (right) doing his impression of a cocktail party pest "the confider" during a funny photo shoot in 1957. Randall had a successful career for nearly 40 years, mostly in TV.

6. Michelle Williams and her boyfriend Health Ledger attend a basketball game in 2006.

7. 17 Year old Scarlett Johansson and her twin brother Hunter Johansson attend the Nintendo Gamecube launch party in 2001. Scarlett has an older sister and a half brother as well, all whom she is close with. Her older sister Vanessa Johansson also acts, but has done very little. Hunter doesn't act.

8. Lillian Gish, D.W. Griffith, and Dorothy Gish pose for a publicity photo in 1922. The sisters were maybe the first actress family to make it big in the silent film era, with Lillian arguable being the greatest silent film actress of all time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85355532.jpg">

9. Kelsey Grammer with his girlfriend Kayte Walsh in 2010. Grammer started dating Walsh while still married to Camille Grammer whom he had been with the past 14 years.

14. Martha Crawford Cantarini being thrown from her horse during a scene for a film sometime in the mid 1950s. Martha Crawford, as she was known throughout her career, was never an actress nor a model. She was just one of the best female stunt women (specifically doing horse riding work) in the business. She worked on 17 films in just 3 years.

15. Dawn Wells at the 2004 TV Land Awards. She was 66 in this picture and looked so much like her character from Gilligan's Island still. She was Miss Nevada in 1959, and competed for the 1960 Miss America pageant. This helped start her career the following year, which was mostly in TV. Despite numerous roles even to this day, she is never remembered for anything else but her 1 iconic character Mary Ann.
